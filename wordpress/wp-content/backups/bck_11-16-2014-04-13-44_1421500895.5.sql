<p>WordPress 4.1 is due for release next month, so we need your help with testing. Here are some highlights of what to test:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our beautiful new default theme, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/09/09/twenty-fifteen/\">Twenty Fifteen</a>. It&#8217;s a clean, mobile-first, blog-focused theme designed through simplicity.</li>
<li>A new <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/11/11/focus-v2-demo-video/\">distraction-free writing mode for the editor</a>. It&#8217;s enabled by default for beta, and we&#8217;d love feedback on it.</li>
<li>The ability to automatically install new language packs right from the General Settings screen (available as long as your site&#8217;s filesystem is writable).</li>
<li>A new inline formatting toolbar for images embedded into posts.</li>
</ul>
<p>There have been a lot of changes for developers to test as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/10/20/update-on-query-improvements-in-4-1/\">Improvements to meta, date, comment, and taxonomy queries</a>, including complex (nested, multiple relation) queries; and querying comment types (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12668\">#12668</a>).</li>
<li>A single term shared across multiple taxonomies is now split into two when updated. For more, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/11/12/an-update-on-the-taxonomy-roadmap/\">see this post</a>, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5809\">#5809</a>, and <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30335\">#30335</a>.</li>
<li>A new and better way for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/10/29/title-tags-in-4-1/\">themes to handle title tags</a>.</li>
<li>Several <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/10/27/toward-a-complete-javascript-api-for-the-customizer/\">improvements to the Customizer API</a>, including contextual panels and sections, and JavaScript templates for controls.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what changes have made it into 4.1, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/week-in-core/\">check out the weekly review posts</a> on the main development blog.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta\">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/\">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major\">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=4.1\">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>
<p><em>Twenty Fifteen theme</em><br />
<em> The beautiful face which hides</em><br />
<em> Many improvements</em></p>

<p><strong>Think you’ve found a bug? </strong>Please post to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">Alpha/Beta area in the support forums</a>. If any known issues come up, you’ll be able to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/5\">find them here</a>.</p>
<p>To test WordPress 4.0 RC1, try the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”).

<p><strong>Developers,</strong> please test your plugins and themes against WordPress 4.0 and update your plugin&#8217;s <em>Tested up to</em> version in the readme to 4.0 before next week. If you find compatibility problems, please be sure to post any issues to the support forums so we can figure those out before the final release. You also may want to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/08/21/introducing-plugin-icons-in-the-plugin-installer/\">give your plugin an icon</a>, which we launched last week and will appear in the dashboard along with banners.</p>

<p><strong>We need your help</strong>. We’re still aiming for a release this month, which means the next week will be critical for identifying and squashing bugs. If you’re just joining us, please see <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2014/07/wordpress-4-0-beta-1/\">the Beta 1 announcement post</a> for what to look out for.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta\">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums, where friendly moderators are standing by. <b>Plugin developers</b><strong>,</strong> if you haven’t tested WordPress 4.0 yet, now is the time — and be sure to update the “tested up to” version for your plugins so they’re listed as compatible with 4.0.</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.0, try the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.0-beta4.zip\">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>

<p>This release fixes a possible denial of service issue in PHP&#8217;s XML processing, reported by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nirgoldshlager\">Nir Goldshlager</a> of the Salesforce.com Product Security Team. It  was fixed by Michael Adams and Andrew Nacin of the WordPress security team and David Rothstein of the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-004\">Drupal security team</a>. This is the first time our two projects have coordinated joint security releases.</p>
<p>WordPress 3.9.2 also contains other security changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixes a possible but unlikely code execution when processing widgets (WordPress is not affected by default), discovered by <a href=\"http://www.buayacorp.com/\">Alex Concha</a> of the WordPress security team.</li>
<li>Prevents information disclosure via XML entity attacks in the external GetID3 library, reported by <a href=\"http://onsec.ru/en/\">Ivan Novikov</a> of ONSec.</li>
<li>Adds protections against brute attacks against CSRF tokens, reported by <a href=\"http://systemoverlord.com/\">David Tomaschik</a> of the Google Security Team.</li>
<li>Contains some additional security hardening, like preventing cross-site scripting that could be triggered only by administrators.</li>
</ul>
<p>We appreciated responsible disclosure of these issues directly to our security team. For more information, see the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.9.2\">release notes</a> or consult the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/3.9?stop_rev=29383&amp;rev=29411\">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/\">Download WordPress 3.9.2</a> or venture over to <strong>Dashboard → Updates</strong> and simply click &#8220;Update Now&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sites that support automatic background updates will be updated to WordPress 3.9.2 within 12 hours. (If you are still on WordPress 3.8.3 or 3.7.3, you will also be updated to 3.8.4 or 3.7.4. We don&#8217;t support older versions, so please update to 3.9.2 for the latest and greatest.)</p>

<p>4.0 is due out next month, but to get there, we need your help testing what we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Previews of <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds\">embedding via URLs</a></strong> in the visual editor and the &#8220;Insert from URL&#8221; tab in the media modal. Try pasting a URL (such as a <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/\">WordPress.tv</a> or YouTube video) onto its own line in the visual editor. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28195\">#28195</a>, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/15490\">#15490</a>)</li>
<li>The <strong>Media Library</strong> now has a &#8220;grid&#8221; view in addition to the existing list view. Clicking on an item takes you into a modal where you can see a larger preview and edit information about that attachment, and you can navigate between items right from the modal without closing it. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24716\">#24716</a>)</li>
<li>We&#8217;re freshening up the <strong>plugin install experience</strong>. You&#8217;ll see some early visual changes as well as more information when searching for plugins and viewing details. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28785\">#28785</a>, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27440\">#27440</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Selecting a language</strong> when you run the installation process. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28577\">#28577</a>)</li>
<li>The <strong>editor</strong> intelligently resizes and its top and bottom bars pin when needed. Browsers don&#8217;t like to agree on where to put things like cursors, so if you find a bug here, please also let us know your browser and operating system. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28328\">#28328</a>)</li>
<li>We&#8217;ve made some improvements to how your keyboard and cursor interact with <strong>TinyMCE views</strong> such as the gallery preview. Much like the editor resizing and scrolling improvements, knowing about your setup is particularly important for bug reports here. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28595\">#28595</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Widgets in the Customizer</strong> are now loaded in a separate panel. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27406\">#27406</a>)</li>
<li>We&#8217;ve also made some changes to some <strong>formatting</strong> functions, so if you see quotes curling in the wrong direction, please file a bug report.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta\">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/\">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major\">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=4.0\">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p><strong>Developers:</strong> Never fear, we haven&#8217;t forgotten you. There&#8217;s plenty for you, too &#8211; more on that in upcoming posts. In the meantime, check out the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/07/08/customizer-improvements-in-4-0/#customizer-panels\">API for panels in the Customizer</a>.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

John Blackbourn announced the beta and outlined a list of features and improvements that you&#8217;ll want to put through the paces. The most visible items include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The new Twenty Fifteen default theme</li>
<li>New distraction-free writing mode for the editor, enabled by default for beta</li>
<li>The ability to automatically install new language packs right from the General Settings screen (available as long as your site&#8217;s file system is writable).</li>
<li>A new inline formatting toolbar for images embedded into posts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The items listed do not include everything that&#8217;s coming in 4.1, but rather the features that require the most testing before the official release. There are also many improvements under the hood for developers to test:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/10/20/update-on-query-improvements-in-4-1/\" target=\"_blank\">Improvements to meta, date, comment, and taxonomy queries</a>, including complex (nested, multiple relation) queries; and querying comment types</li>
<li>A single term shared across multiple taxonomies is now split into two when updated.</li>
<li>A new and better way for themes to handle <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-1-to-introduce-theme-support-for-the-title-tag\" target=\"_blank\">title tags</a>.</li>
<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/10/27/toward-a-complete-javascript-api-for-the-customizer/\" target=\"_blank\">Improvements to the Customizer API</a>, including contextual panels and sections, and JavaScript templates for controls.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/focus-project-and-session-ui-approved-for-merge-into-wordpress-4-1\" target=\"_blank\">Focus project (the new DFW) was merged into core along with the user session UI</a>. So far, reaction to the new distraction-free writing mode has been mixed, with the most vocal feedback coming from those who are not looking forward to turning the feature off on multiple sites. WordPress core contributors will be gathering feedback during the beta period in order to determine whether or not the new DFW mode will be shipped as &#8220;on&#8221; by default. Having it off by default decreases users&#8217; ability to discover the new DFW mode, but it would also help it to be more universally well-received.</p>
<p>If you want to jump in and help test 4.1 beta 1 with all its exciting improvements, the easiest way is to get hooked up with the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin. This will allow you to update your test install to use the “bleeding edge nightlies.&#8221; The other option is to download the zip file from Blackbourn&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2014/11/wordpress-4-1-beta-1/\" target=\"_blank\">beta 1 announcement</a> post.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 14 Nov 2014 23:15:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"

You&#8217;d be hard-pressed to find a theme that is easier to set up. It offers just a handful of options built into the native customizer, including the ability to customize the header colors and header background image.</p>
<p>The theme is mobile-friendly, with a hidden sidebar that houses the primary navigation and widgets. It also has support for a footer menu and a social links menu at the top. With the help of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/\" target=\"_blank\">Regenerate Thumbnails</a> plugin, you can have an existing site looking just like the Masonry demo in a matter of a couple minutes.</p>

<h3>The Story Behind Masonry: A WordPress.org Theme Collaboration</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s a unique story behind the creation of this theme. Masonry was started as a collaboration project between WordPress theme designer <a href=\"http://uzelac.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Emil Uzelac</a> and <a href=\"http://devrix.com/\" target=\"_blank\">DeviX</a>, a development company founded by Mario Peshev and Stanko Metodiev.</p>
<p>Uzelac is most well-known for his work on the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-wordpress-theme-reviewer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.org Theme Review Team</a> and his popular free <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/themes/responsive\" target=\"_blank\">Responsive theme</a> that was eventually <a href=\"http://mattreport.com/trent-lapinski-cyberchimps/\" target=\"_blank\">acquired by CyberChimps</a>. He put out a tweet, announcing his availability:</p>
<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p>You have a WordPress project and I have 2 weeks free, let’s talk! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash\">#WordPress</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Emil Uzelac (@emiluzelac) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emiluzelac/status/508451598620979200\">September 7, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Uzelac was Peshev&#8217;s mentor for the Theme Review Team in 2011 before he promoted him to a reviewer. This was back in the days when you had to pass more than a dozen test reviews before moving on. &#8220;Emil is super dedicated to the WPTRT and a great person and should not be left unemployed at any time,&#8221; Peshev said. He responded to his tweet, and a theme collaboration was born.</p>
<p>DevriX set out some ideas for the theme and then hired Uzelac to design and develop it. &#8220;We have added several things and will keep maintaining it, but we paid him for a full zip file that was (almost) ready to go on WordPress.org,&#8221; Peshev said. &#8220;Since he&#8217;s one of the TRT admins, it was the easiest way to cover the hundreds of requirements there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peshev said that DevriX gets no practical business benefit from the theme, as the company doesn&#8217;t perform customization or installation services. He saw it as a good way to give back to the community while also helping volunteers to find more work for their expertise.</p>
<h3>Making the Theme Review Team More Visible</h3>
<p>As a result of this collaboration experience, Peshev discovered that there is no easy way for people to find and hire those who are skilled at preparing a theme for approval on WordPress.org. He suggested that a directory of Theme Review team members might be a good idea for promoting the folks who have  these abilities.</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no clear way to hire any of them for theme reviews or building a theme following the WordPress.org guidelines. I assume that small and medium agencies would be willing to pay for professional reviews or getting themes built for any reason, which would support both parties. I&#8217;ve had several clients paying for code reviews and fixing themes in order to get them in the WordPress.org Theme Directory.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the past, themes have sometimes taken months to go through the process, after getting rejected a few times and then finally gaining approval. Hiring someone to help prepare a theme to pass WordPress.org guidelines can save a company a good chunk of time. <strong>&#8220;Given the 4-6 week period to get a theme reviewed, that&#8217;s a valuable service,&#8221;</strong> Peshev said.</p>
<p>A directory would help people in the community to be able to identify the qualified Theme Review Team volunteers available to hire for code review, even for products that are marketed outside of WordPress.org. &#8220;Same goes for all the other teams that don&#8217;t get props in the Core releases, such as docs, polyglots and accessibility&#8221; Peshev said. &#8220;In this case, theme reviewers are not listed anywhere and not publicly available for hire (for new themes or professional reviews).&#8221;</p>
<p>In the case of Uzelac and Peshev&#8217;s collaboration, the end result is a nice free theme for the community to enjoy. With all the volunteer hours put into reviewing themes for WordPress.org, do you think reviewers could benefit from being listed in a directory? Or would this needlessly complicate the relationship between reviewers and submissions on WordPress.org?</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 14 Nov 2014 22:09:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"

<p>One topic to come out of the discussion surrounding the <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/loopconf-sparks-controversy-with-tickets-priced-at-800\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/loopconf-sparks-controversy-with-tickets-priced-at-800\">cost to attend LoopConf</a> is the idea that WordCamps can&#8217;t be developer focused. One of the most exciting aspects of LoopConf is the chance to dive deep into technical discussions. WordCamps generally cater to a wide range of skill levels, which some feel prevent these types of discussions from occurring.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing in the <a title=\"http://plan.wordcamp.org/\" href=\"http://plan.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp guidelines</a> that state WordCamps have to cater to all experience levels, it&#8217;s just what most organizers do based on the needs of their local community. In 2011, <a title=\"http://mor10.com/\" href=\"http://mor10.com/\">Morten Rand-Hendriksen</a> organized an event called <a title=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110926234935/http://wordcampdevelopers.com/\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110926234935/http://wordcampdevelopers.com/\">WordCamp Developers</a> held in Vancouver, BC. WordPress developers and designers interested in learning about practical, applied WordPress development by industry leaders and local WordPress practitioners attended the event.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Flynn O&#8217;Connor co-organized <a title=\"http://2014.vancouver.wordcamp.org/\" href=\"http://2014.vancouver.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Vancouver, BC Developer Edition</a>. It was a one day event <a title=\"http://2014.vancouver.wordcamp.org/sessions/\" href=\"http://2014.vancouver.wordcamp.org/sessions/\">filled with WordPress developer topics</a> including, an introduction to the command line, advanced custom fields, and getting started with unit tests. I interviewed O&#8217;Connor to find out how he marketed the event and what he did to achieve a relevant audience.</p>
<h2>Interview With Flynn O&#8217;Connor</h2>
<p><strong>At what point did you realize you needed to have a Developer Edition of WordCamp Vancouver?</strong></p>
<p>This is something that our team discussed after the previous year&#8217;s WordCamp completed. There was a desire to not only create a camp for WordPress developers but also a WordPress focused event that would be of interest to the larger tech community within Vancouver to see what WordPress could do. While attending other events like <a title=\"http://2014.cascadiajs.com/\" href=\"http://2014.cascadiajs.com/\">CascadiaJS</a> conference, I found myself correcting a lot of people&#8217;s old pre-conceived notions of what WordPress is and can do now.</p>
<p><strong>How did you market WordCamp Vancouver Developer Edition so that a majority of the attendees are developer or designer oriented?</strong></p>
<p>We tried to be clear with our content that this event was going to focus on building with WordPress and not necessarily about end user topics. In emails, on the website, social media and in community posts like the one <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-vancouver-to-hold-developer-edition-in-july\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-vancouver-to-hold-developer-edition-in-july\">WPTavern published</a> about our event we tried to get the message out that if you can or wanted to know how to build on WordPress, this would be an event for you.</p>
<p>We also connected with other tech related meet up groups and asked for the assistance in getting the word out about our event and reached out to several schools that offered web development programs and offered their students discount tickets. Even so, there are some people who are going to attend because they&#8217;re aware of WordPress and want to see what it&#8217;s all about but don&#8217;t know how to design or develop for it. From our experience, we&#8217;ve found you can&#8217;t really stop that.</p>
<p><strong>What type of feedback did you get after the event? Did some attendees complain that the content was over their head?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we did get some people who said some of the talks were advanced for them. But from the ones I talked to that brought this up, quite of a few of them were not discouraged by this. We can’t cater to everyone and make everyone happy but if we provide our attendees content that will challenge them, then hopefully, we are encouraging them to learn more and helping them to become better developers.</p>
<p><strong>What advice can you give to organizers who want to put on a developer focused WordCamp?</strong></p>
<p>Reach out to the tech community beyond WordPress, not only for attendees but also speakers. Many of them will be happy to help. Don’t be afraid of the content being too advanced for some attendees but try to balance out the talks so that less experienced developers don’t feel overwhelmed the entire time.</p>
<p>Talk to meet up and smaller local event planners to get a sense for your community&#8217;s general skill level so you can better anticipate likely attendance levels for the more advanced talks. I am one of the co-organizers for the Vancouver meet up and I focus on the dev branch, so I had a decent idea of how many high level developers in our community would actually attend these events.</p>
<h2>Understanding The Needs Of The Local Community</h2>
<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/LocalImage.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33505]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-33651\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/LocalImage.png?resize=640%2C126\" alt=\"Local Image\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/arimoore/1232161364/\">arimoore</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/\">cc</a>
<p>Organizers are <a title=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2013/08/20/organizing-a-non-wordcamp/\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2013/08/20/organizing-a-non-wordcamp/\">encouraged to experiment</a> and break from the mold while still following the guidelines. WordCamp Vancouver Developer Edition proves it&#8217;s possible and if you look at <a title=\"http://i0.wp.com/2014.vancouver.wordcamp.org/files/2014/07/WordCamp-Vancouver-2014-Public-Budget-Sheet11.png\" href=\"http://i0.wp.com/2014.vancouver.wordcamp.org/files/2014/07/WordCamp-Vancouver-2014-Public-Budget-Sheet11.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33505]\">their budget sheet</a>, it cost just over $18,000. So not only can organizers create a WordPress developer centric event using the WordCamp branding, the financial support of doing so makes it much more affordable.</p>
<p>One of the keys to the success of WordCamp Vancouver for developers and designers is understanding the needs of the local WordPress community. If there is sufficient demand and the community is large enough, consider organizing an event in your area. There&#8217;s also no rules in the guidelines that limit the amount of WordCamps per year in a given city. This means organizers can continue to have traditional WordCamps while organizing a separate event catered to developers.</p>
<p>I want to know from those who have organized 500-1,000 person WordCamps if you plan to branch out and create smaller, niche events while using the WordCamp branding? If so, please let us know in the comments. Also feel free to share concerns, ideas, or ask questions related to organizing a niche event.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 14 Nov 2014 20:33:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"

<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/jp-bot-plugins.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18338]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/jp-bot-plugins.jpg?resize=700%2C222\" alt=\"jp-bot-plugins\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33603\" /></a></p>
<p>One of his most popular plugins is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack-markdown/\" target=\"_blank\">JP Markdown</a>, which essentially duplicates Jetpack&#8217;s <a href=\"http://jetpack.me/support/markdown/\" target=\"_blank\">Markdown module</a>. It allows you to compose WordPress content in Markdown and have it published as HTML. I gave the plugin a test run and found that it works as advertised:</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/markdown-test.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18338]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/markdown-test.jpg?resize=660%2C540\" alt=\"markdown-test\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33614\" /></a></p>
<p>JP Markdown even includes the &#8220;Use Markdown for Comments&#8221; feature that you can enable under <strong>Settings > Discussion</strong>. This plugin is a solid option if you like the Markdown module in Jetpack but don&#8217;t want everything else that comes with it.</p>
<p>The JP Bot family of plugins extracted from Jetpack currently includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack-sharing/\" target=\"_blank\">JP Sharing</a> &#8211; Share content with Facebook, Twitter, et al.</li>
<li><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack-widget-visibility/\" target=\"_blank\">JP Widget Visibility</a> &#8211; Control what pages your widgets appear on.</li>
<li><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack-markdown/\" target=\"_blank\">JP Markdown</a> &#8211; Write in Markdown, publish in HTML.</li>
<li><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/jp-custom-css/\" target=\"_blank\">JP Custom CSS</a> &#8211; Customize your site’s CSS without modifying your theme.</li>
<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack-gravatar-hovercards/\" target=\"_blank\">JP Gravatar Hovercards</a> &#8211; Show a pop-up business card of your users&#8217; gravatar profiles in comments.</li>
<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack-omnisearch/\" target=\"_blank\">JP Omnisearch</a> &#8211; A single search box, that lets you search many different things.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using Jetpack requires being connected to WordPress.com. While some users appreciate the convenience and professional support they receive from the Jetpack team, there are many who have reservations about hooking their site up to another third-party service. JP Bot&#8217;s <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/wpjp/\" target=\"_blank\">collection of Jetpack-extraction plugins</a> offer you an alternative to many of Jetpack&#8217;s most popular modules.

<p>When WordPress is used heavily as a content management system, taxonomies play a very important role for grouping information. While your standard blog might only have a handful of categories, more content-heavy sites can include hundreds of terms within custom taxonomies.</p>
<p>Scrolling through an impossibly long list of categories or terms can be a clunky experience in the post editor. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/taxonomy-filter/\" target=\"_blank\">Taxonomy Filter</a> is a new solution for this, created by Andrea Landonio, a software engineer at Condé Nast in Milan.</p>
<p>The plugin allows users to filter hierarchical term taxonomies inside the WordPress admin. Specifically, it adds a custom input field for filtering taxonomies when a user is assigning them in the post editor. Here&#8217;s an example with the default category taxonomy:</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/category-filter.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33566]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/category-filter.jpg?resize=282%2C357\" alt=\"category-filter\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33578\" /></a></p>
<p>Categories are automatically narrowed down as you type, so that you can easily locate the one you&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/category-filtering.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33566]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/category-filtering.jpg?resize=282%2C279\" alt=\"category-filtering\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33579\" /></a></p>
<p>The Taxonomy Filter plugin has a settings page that allows you configure which taxonomies you want to make filterable. Currently, it only works with hierarchical taxonomies, including default categories and <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Taxonomies\" target=\"_blank\">custom taxonomies</a>. (It does not support non-hierarchical tags.)</p>
<p>The settings page gives you two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable on post management pages (allow you to turn on/off filter field)</li>
<li>Hide filter field if taxonomy is empty</li>
</ul>
<p>I tested the plugin and found that it works as advertised to quickly filter taxonomies. One added benefit is that it&#8217;s likely to keep users from impatiently creating new categories when they overlook an existing category due to too much scrolling. The instinct is to just create a new one which may have a similar name to one that already exists. This further bloats the list and makes categories less effective for grouping content.</p>
<p>Installing the Taxonomy Filter plugin is one small way that you can make assigning a taxonomy a little more convenient and less clunky in the admin. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/taxonomy-filter/\" target=\"_blank\">Download</a> it for free from WordPress.org.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 13 Nov 2014 20:55:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"

Last week Jeff Chandler explored <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/how-the-focus-project-plans-to-enhance-distraction-free-writing-in-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">how the Focus Project plans to enhance distraction-free writing</a> in WordPress. If you haven&#8217;t been following the project, it&#8217;s essentially a complete re-think of the way WordPress has approached the DFW feature.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/dfw.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33514]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/dfw.jpg?resize=417%2C395\" alt=\"dfw\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-33545\" /></a>Mark Jaquith posted a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/11/11/focus-v2-demo-video/\" target=\"_blank\">demo video</a> of the feature earlier this week when proposing it to be <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29806\" target=\"_blank\">merged into core</a> for 4.1. If you haven&#8217;t tested it yet, this video gives you a good idea of how the feature will work.</p>
<p>In general, WordPress users have found distraction-free writing to be a valuable experience but are dissatisfied with the disconnect of being separated from the rest of the publishing tools in the editor. The Focus Project minimizes the transition, automatically fading the non-essential parts of the editor when you start typing. It keeps the the publishing tools just a mouse swipe away.</p>
<p>The old DFW button is now changed to be a disabling toggle. For the 4.1 beta, this new feature will be automatically on, and WordPress core contributors will use this time to gather feedback and decide whether or not it should be on or off by default. If left on by default, it will be the most visible new feature in 4.1, since it impacts anyone who uses the content editor.</p>
<h3>Session UI Approved to Merge Into Core</h3>
<p>The second item approved for merge into 4.1 is the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30264\" target=\"_blank\">user session UI</a>, which is essentially a button that displays when a user has more than one active session. When clicked, the button will log the user out of all other sessions.</p>
<p>During today&#8217;s core development chat, Blackbourn also outlined plans for the putting the session UI feature on track for future improvements. &#8220;We&#8217;ll use the <a href=\"https://github.com/johnbillion/wp-session-manager\" target=\"_blank\">session UI repo on GitHub</a> for future iterations (and we&#8217;ll do it as a proper feature plugin too if necessary),&#8221; he said. &#8220;Or it might just not be developed any further.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also clarified that planned improvements to extension installation and update screens will not make it into this release. &#8220;So unfortunately due to the work that some core folks have been doing on 4.0.1, the improvements that were slated for the plugin and theme install (and update) screens has not progressed past mockups, so that has been shelved for 4.1,&#8221; Blackbourn said.</p>
<h3>Shared Terms Will be Split in WordPress 4.1</h3>
<p>Under the hood, developers can look forward to progress on the taxonomy roadmap. Boone Gorges has made <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/11/12/an-update-on-the-taxonomy-roadmap/\" target=\"_blank\">huge strides in fixing issues with shared terms</a>. Unraveling this knot was an extraordinary feat, not unlike navigating through a minefield, when it comes to backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>As of 4.1, updating a shared term will cause it to be split into two separate terms. This solves a common problem where you update a term and have the others changed unintentionally. It also paves the way for more exciting improvements to taxonomy meta and post relationships, as Andrew Nacin <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/07/28/potential-roadmap-for-taxonomy-meta-and-post-relationships/\" target=\"_blank\">outlined</a> last year.</p>
<p>The new <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/twenty-fifteen-officially-added-to-the-development-version-of-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">Twenty Fifteen default theme</a> should also ship in this release, ready just in time for the new year. Blackbourn and contributors are aiming to have WordPress 4.1 beta 1 available Thursday around lunchtime GMT. The official release is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/version-4-1-project-schedule/\" target=\"_blank\">scheduled</a> for the week of December 8th.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 13 Nov 2014 00:28:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"

<p>WordPress recently adopted <a href=\"https://slack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Slack</a> as its primary communication tool for contributor teams, largely replacing IRC. When trac tickets are mentioned in Slack, they are automatically linked up, which helps contributors reference and connect discussions. So far, the app has been enthusiastically received, especially since it offers a far more mobile-friendly option for asynchronous communication.</p>
<p>WordPress-related projects outside of core have also started using Slack for team collaboration. Contributors to the <a href=\"http://pods.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Pods Framework</a> are finding Slack to be instrumental for staying connected. That&#8217;s why <a href=\"http://joshpress.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Pollock</a>, community manager for the project, created <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress-slack-integration/\" target=\"_blank\">bbPress Slack Integration</a>. This new plugin allows you to send notifications of new bbPress topics and replies to your Slack channel of choice.</p>
<h3>Staying on Top of Support Requests</h3>
<p>The Pods team already had GitHub and Asana integrations with their channels. These were working well, but they were missing updates from their bbPress-powered <a href=\"http://pods.io/forums\" target=\"_blank\">support forums</a> in the team&#8217;s support channel.</p>
<p>&#8220;The external integrations help keep us aware of what’s happening, while we’re working,&#8221; Pollock said. &#8220;This plugin does the same thing for support requests and makes us more responsive when we are in &#8216;Pods Mode.\'&#8221;</p>
<p>The bbPress Slack Integration plugin uses the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/HTTP_API\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress HTTP API</a> and a Slack webhook to send notifications from the forum where it is installed.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/bbpress-slack.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33359]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/bbpress-slack.png?resize=607%2C108\" alt=\"bbpress-slack\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33501\" /></a></p>
<p>In order to use the plugin with your own bbPress forums, you&#8217;ll first need to add a new Slack webhook by visiting:</p>
<p><code>https://your-team-name.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook</code></p>

<p>One of the toughest battles a U.S. military veteran faces after returning from active duty is finding a job and reentering the work force. The battle is so tough that in 2011, First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden came together to launch <a title=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/joiningforces\" href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/joiningforces\">Joining Forces</a>. Joining Forces is a nationwide initiative calling all Americans to rally around service members, veterans, and their families and support them through wellness, education, and employment opportunities.</p>
<p><a title=\"http://www.jamesdalman.com/\" href=\"http://www.jamesdalman.com/\">James Dalman</a>, who honorably served in the Oklahoma National Guard, is doing his part to help veterans find jobs in the web technology industry through his non-profit organization, <a title=\"https://www.happyjoe.org\" href=\"https://www.happyjoe.org\">Happy Joe</a>.</p>
<h2>The Happy Joe Mission</h2>
<p>Happy Joe is a 501 c3 non-profit organization that helps U.S. veterans with entrepreneurship and employment opportunities. Training initiatives prepare veterans not only for a career in the web technology industry, but also provide the skills necessary to start their own businesses. Most of the <a title=\"http://www.happyjoe.org/happy-joe-team/\" href=\"http://www.happyjoe.org/happy-joe-team/\">team behind the organization</a> is either in active duty or has previous military experience.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/HappyJoeLogo.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33365]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33486\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/HappyJoeLogo.png?resize=385%2C111\" alt=\"Happy Joe Logo\" /></a></p>
<p>The organization&#8217;s mission is to give back to veterans in a measurable way that makes a deep impact.</p>
<blockquote><p>Happy Joe provides career placement and job training in the web technology industry free of charge to our veterans. We help them navigate their re-entry into the civilian marketplace and advocate for the rights that they’ve earned the right to. And we partner with the best companies and resources to ensure that our military veterans have every opportunity to become successful after their commitment to service is over.</p></blockquote>
<p>Training and job placement programs are funded primarily by the <a title=\"https://www.happyjoe.org/donate/\" href=\"https://www.happyjoe.org/donate/\">Happy Joe Scholarship Fund</a>. 100% of the donations and contributions go towards the efforts of working with veterans. Funds are also obtained through a sponsorship program several companies routinely contribute to, including <a title=\"http://automattic.com/\" href=\"http://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> and <a title=\"http://ithemes.com/\" href=\"http://ithemes.com/\">iThemes</a>.</p>
<h2>WordPress&#8217; Role at Happy Joe</h2>
<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/WPBootCamp.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33365]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-33462\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/WPBootCamp.png?resize=639%2C200\" alt=\"WordPress Boot Camp\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/vamcmag/3098352208/\">MizGingerSnaps</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/\">cc</a>
<p>WordPress is the cornerstone used to help veterans learn a valuable skill. By learning WordPress, veterans can take advantage of valuable opportunities to work in the field either as an employee or through contract work. Dalman tells the Tavern that in 2015, as part of the training initiative, he&#8217;ll launch WP Bootcamps. &#8220;WP Bootcamps will be tailored to the military community and help our Armed Forces veterans to set up resume style websites on WordPress so that they can be seen as technology relevant.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Success Stories</h2>
<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuccessFeaturedImage.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33365]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-32204\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuccessFeaturedImage.png?resize=636%2C278\" alt=\"Success Featured Image\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/seeveeaar/2035597695/\">seeveeaar</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/\">cc</a>
<p>When asked if there are any success stories, Dalman points to himself as an example, &#8220;Personally, WordPress has allowed me as a veteran to launch very successful businesses in the marketplace, in addition to helping other veterans do the same. I am not the most tech savvy person in the world, but WordPress has provided me with the ability to make a great living, doing work I love to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Learning and working with WordPress affords him the opportunity to travel and meet amazing people in the community. When asked by veterans if they can make a living in web technology using WordPress, Dalman responds, &#8220;I tell them if I can do it, they certainly can!&#8221; Some of the veterans taking advantage of Happy Joe are homeless or in deep financial trouble but are using WordPress to make a better life for themselves. Dalman notes that success stories of members will soon be shared on the Happy Joe website.</p>
<h2>Happy Joe Needs Your Financial Support</h2>
<p>While spreading the word about Happy Joe is appreciated, Dalman says the organization first and foremost needs financial assistance. &#8220;We need people to help fund the training and mentoring of our veterans. We have a lot of people who are sharing the story and mission of Happy Joe and we are <strong>VERY</strong> appreciative of that. However, we need sponsorships and donations to make a true difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>Happy Joe is working with around a dozen veterans with more on the way. According to Dalman, there are a half-dozen companies willing and ready to hire veterans. However, the organization can&#8217;t make it happen without funding. &#8220;There is work that we need to do to get veterans up to speed and ready. This takes time, money, and commitment. So please, go and <a title=\"https://www.happyjoe.org/donate/\" href=\"https://www.happyjoe.org/donate/\">donate</a> to Happy Joe today so that we <strong>ALL</strong> can make a difference.&#8221;</p>

Keep in mind that it&#8217;s a 501c3 non-profit organization meaning <strong>donations are tax-deductible</strong>. 100% of public donations and contributions go directly to helping the veterans Happy Joe works with. There&#8217;s also a <a title=\"https://www.happyjoe.org/sponsors/\" href=\"https://www.happyjoe.org/sponsors/\">sponsorship page</a> that explains not only how companies can get involved but also the benefits each sponsorship level provides. For example, Alpha Team sponsors which are the highest tier receive VIP access to trained and dependable veterans.</p>
<p>Veterans day in the U.S. is a reminder for Americans to remember and thank those who honorably serve or served in the military, it&#8217;s organizations like Happy Joe that think of them and give back year round.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 12 Nov 2014 21:30:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"

<p><a title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/note/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/note/\">Note</a> is a simple and easy to use widget for editing bits of text, within the widget via the customizer developed by <a title=\"http://www.slocumstudio.com/\" href=\"http://www.slocumstudio.com/\">Slocum Studio</a>. Although you can edit text widgets in the customizer, it&#8217;s a boring experience and requires HTML knowledge to format text. Note enables you to add and edit content live from within the widget similar to a frontend editor.</p>
<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/NoteWidgetinAction2.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33400]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-33442\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/NoteWidgetinAction2.png?resize=990%2C390\" alt=\"Note Widget in Action\" /></a>Note Widget in Action
<p>From within the customizer, you can add a Title, apply a CSS class, or click the button which is like a shortcut to edit the widget&#8217;s content. One thing I noticed immediately is that applying a title doesn&#8217;t match the behavior of other widgets in WordPress. As you can see in the screenshot, the widget title doesn&#8217;t inherit the same style as the others. According to Matt Medeiros of Slocum Studio, this behavior is intentional.</p>
<blockquote><p>We wanted the writing experience to be as pure as possible when using Note. We decided to omit displaying widget titles as part of that experience in the first version, but plan to revisit that in an upcoming release.</p></blockquote>
<p>It may be intentional, but it gives me a sense that either the widget or my theme is broken. At its most basic level, Note should function the same way as a default text widget. Hopefully in a future version, the team will change the behavior to match that of a regular widget with an option to show or hide the title.</p>
<p>Not only can you edit the widget&#8217;s content without visiting the backend, you can do it in style. Simply highlight text within the widget and a toolbar shows up allowing you to format the text. Note has a <strong>What You See Is What You Get</strong> interface. This is convenient since you no longer have to edit content, click save and publish, then refresh the page to see the changes.</p>
<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/NotesToolbar.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33400]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-33443\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/NotesToolbar.png?resize=598%2C117\" alt=\"Note Toolbar\" /></a>Note Toolbar
<p>One feature missing from Note is the ability to add media, but Medeiros confirmed it will be added in a future release. While testing Note, I encountered a bug that added a / to every word that has an apostrophe. For example, I&#8217;ve turned into I/&#8217;ve. The bug presents itself when the customizer is open and a page refresh occurs. The team is aware of the bug and is working on a fix.</p>
<p>Overall, I like what I see from Note. Once a few bugs are squashed and the ability to display the widget title is added, it will be a great replacement for the default Text widget. Note is <a title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/note/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/note/\">available for free</a> on the WordPress plugin directory. You can also follow development of Note <a title=\"https://github.com/sdsweb/note/\" href=\"https://github.com/sdsweb/note/\">on Github</a> where you can also file bug reports and contribute patches.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Nov 2014 22:44:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"

<p>The <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API\" target=\"_blank\">Shortcode API</a> was introduced in 2008 when <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2008/03/wordpress-25-brecker/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress 2.5</a> was released. Over the past six years, the UI for adding shortcodes has changed very little, despite the fact that they remain a big part of how many WordPress users structure complex content.</p>
<p><a href=\"https://github.com/fusioneng/Shortcake\" target=\"_blank\">Shortcake</a> is a new project created by the folks at <a href=\"http://next.fusion.net/2014/11/10/introducing-shortcake/\" target=\"_blank\">Fusion</a> with the aim of bringing new life to shortcodes. The plugin is aptly named, as it was designed to make shortcodes a piece of cake for users.</p>
<p>Shortcake gives developers an easy way to register a UI for their shortcodes by utilizing 4.0&#8217;s <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/29178\" target=\"_blank\">changes to TinyMCE views</a>. Developers can use the Shortcake plugin alongside add_shortcode to create a user-friendly interface for adding shortcode content and attributes to pages/posts.</p>
<p>The Fusion team provided a before and after example of editing a shortcode for a pullquote, with an <a href=\"https://github.com/fusioneng/Shortcode-UI/blob/master/dev.php\" target=\"_blank\">example file</a> to show you how to use it:</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/shortcake-example.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33308]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/shortcake-example.png?resize=645%2C655\" alt=\"shortcake-example\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33427\" /></a></p>
<p>The plugin currently supports the following input types: text, checkbox, textarea, radio, select, email, url, number, and date. The team behind it plans to improve it to support data sources and will also be publishing more documentation and example usages.</p>
<p>The VIP team at Automattic liked the plugin so much that they have now made it available for all WordPress.com VIP customers, which is a testament to its quality. Fusion plans to present the project at the next <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Media-WordPress-Meetup/\" target=\"_blank\">Big Media &amp; Enterprise WordPress meetup</a> in New York.</p>

While WordPress core has many contributors who are sponsored by companies, the sister projects have yet to receive this kind of investment from the community.</p>
<p>Jacoby is a longtime WordPress developer/contributor and the project lead on <a href=\"https://buddypress.org\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyPress</a> and <a href=\"http://bbpress.org\" target=\"_blank\">bbPress</a>. WordPress depends heavily on the continued maintenance and improvement of the sister projects and he believes that they can benefit from having a dedicated developer.</p>
<p>BuddyPress is the plugin that powers the 16 million WordPress.org profiles, activity stream, and badge system. The WordPress.org support forums, along with the thousands of plugin and theme support forums, are all powered by bbPress. <a href=\"http://blog.glotpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">GlotPress</a> is a BackPress-powered application that enabled WordPress, BuddyPress, and bbPress to be translated into different languages. Improvements to GlotPress are critical for WordPress&#8217; global mission to democratize publishing.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span class=\"pullquote alignleft\">WordPress is more community than software, yet the software that powers the community has nobody working on it full time</span>,&#8221; Jacoby said. &#8220;I want to change this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The campaign came about after developer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/miss_jwo\" target=\"_blank\">Jenny Wong</a> made the suggestion during events surrounding WordCamp San Francisco. Wong has been instrumental in organizing community contribution days and has a passion for bringing people together. <strong>&#8220;I think a lot more would be done if there are dedicated people all over the community,&#8221;</strong> she said.</p>
<p>Jacoby had considered the idea before but didn&#8217;t think there would be enough people interested in supporting it. With the suggestion and support from Wong and others at WCSF, he decided to give it a try. &#8220;BuddyPress, bbPress, and GlotPress came up so frequently, and I was pulled into so many discussions. I felt happy for how important those projects are to everyone, and sad that I haven’t found a way to truly dedicate myself to them,&#8221; Jacoby told the Tavern.</p>
<p>&#8220;Near the end of the first day of the contributor summit, I was more emotional about it than I expected to be, and had a hard time translating that into words. Thankfully, Jen Mylo (who has always been super supportive to me) summed it up really nicely, and Jenny Wong followed up with the idea of raising money via Indiegogo.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jacoby&#8217;s aim is to work on the projects &#8220;while remaining an independent and impartial entity with a dedicated period of distraction-free time.&#8221; Specifically, he plans to target the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Query and caching performance improvements to both BuddyPress and bbPress (to help them power the almost 20 million user profiles and the immense amount of activity going into them from all of the support forums)</li>
<li>Media and Attachment support in BuddyPress</li>
<li>Per-forum moderation in bbPress to help with plugin and theme moderation on WordPress.org.</li>
</ul>
<p>Progress on the sister projects has been slow, since current contributions are all volunteer-driven from folks who have other obligations. Jacoby was originally reluctant to attempt a fundraising campaign but recognizes the necessity of having the money available for distraction-free work. If the goal is not met, he will prorate the funds and will work in a dedicated capacity on the projects for as long as the funds allow.</p>
<p>Within the first few hours of launching the campaign, Jacoby has already surpassed 20% of the goal.

<p>Last week <a href=\"http://loopconf.io/\" target=\"_blank\">LoopConf</a> announced that <a href=\"http://us9.campaign-archive1.com/?u=d852b760c6208bf25844e3b3d&id=d49b632196\" target=\"_blank\">early bird tickets will go on sale November 20th</a>. The conference is aimed at developers and organizers are planning for 700 &#8211; 1,000 attendees in Las Vegas on the weekend of May 7-8, 2015.</p>
<p>A bit of controversy has surfaced regarding the ticket pricing, as LoopConf emerges as one of the most expensive WordPress-oriented conferences to date. With early bird tickets priced at $600 and regular tickets at $800, the combined sponsorship donations and estimated ticket sales have the potential to bring the total event budget just shy of a million dollars.</p>
<p>Although events in this price range are not unheard of in the web industry, with many charging ticket prices in the thousands, WordPress-oriented conferences have traditionally been inexpensive. Because LoopConf is not endorsed by or affiliated with the WordPress Foundation, it doesn&#8217;t have to follow the <a href=\"http://plan.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">guidelines</a> set for WordCamps. Organizers of WP Foundation-sponsored events must <a href=\"http://plan.wordcamp.org/agreement-among-wordcamp-organizers-speakers-sponsors-and-volunteers/\" target=\"_blank\">agree</a> to make the event &#8220;accessible to as many people as possible, regardless of financial status.&#8221;</p>
<p>LoopConf ticket pricing poses a stark contrast to traditional WordPress-oriented events, drawing sharp criticism for catering to an elite segment of developers, while pricing out the vast majority of others in the community.</p>
<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p>So <a href=\"https://twitter.com/loopconf\">@loopconf</a> tickets are $600 for early bird and $800 regular? Wow. Good luck with that. You just priced out 90% of the WP community.</p>

<p>Supporters of LoopConf ticket prices count it as a step forward in legitimizing WordPress as a mainstream career opportunity. Eric Mann, in a response piece titled  <a href=\"https://eamann.com/biz/wordpress-comes-age/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Comes of Age</a>, highlights the fact that some employers have been reluctant to pay for flights and accommodation for a conference with a $25-40 ticket price.</p>
<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/norcross\">@norcross</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/williamsba\">@williamsba</a> That might actually be a big step forward in legitimizing WP as a mainstream career opportunity.</p>

<p>I spoke with Brad Williams, one of the most vocal community members questioning the ticket prices, to find out if <a href=\"http://webdevstudios.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WebDevStudios</a> would be sending any of its employees to LoopConf. &#8220;Most likely not, unfortunately,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a lot of money even for an agency to cover without understanding the value of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Williams said he was not opposed to the conference, but that it&#8217;s tough to assess the value that an attendee will receive. &#8220;If it&#8217;s pricey, but justified, it might be worth sending some of our devs,&#8221; he said.  <strong>&#8220;Honestly it&#8217;s tough to say because we could also send them to 10+ WordCamps for that price.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>When LoopConf posted ticket prices, the email announcement said, &#8220;Think of it as more of a celebration of WordPress than a conference.&#8221; Without a full list of speakers and topics, aside from the generally well-known WordPress speakers featured on the homepage, onlookers are left scratching their heads.</p>
<p>Amid controversy surrounding the high ticket prices, the organizers of the LoopConf posted a detailed <a href=\"http://loopconf.io/faq/\" target=\"_blank\">FAQ</a> section to the site to answer some of the public&#8217;s most pressing questions. The document helps to clarify what the organizers believe to be the value of the ticket price.</p>
<p>When <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryandonsullivan\" target=\"_blank\">Ryan Sullivan</a> set out to create a WordPress conference for developers, he had no idea that LoopConf would be pioneering a new segment of WordPress events. The organizing team, which includes a couple of experienced ng-conf organizers, was surprised to learn of the controversy surrounding the ticket pricing.</p>
<p>Unlike a WordCamp, LoopConf is a for-profit endeavor and the team has no obligation to be financially transparent. &#8220;We won&#8217;t be publishing our budget,&#8221; Sullivan told the Tavern. &#8220;This is a for-profit endeavor but not to the degree most people think. Our margins are actually not very big, and basically cover our time and efforts for putting on the event itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our number one goal is that everyone leaves feeling like it was a great investment, and if it ends up we risk a portion of our profits to make that a reality, then we&#8217;re fine with that.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also doesn&#8217;t see any realistic way that the budget will reach a million dollars. &#8220;We are planning much more conservatively than that,&#8221; he said. What does he say to critics who believe the ticket prices to be exorbitant?</p>
<blockquote><p>The ticket price is for the experience itself. Compared to other tech conferences outside of WordPress our prices are actually average or below average. I wish I had a way to illustrate how amazing this event will be without just having to say &#8220;this event is going to be amazing&#8221;, but that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re at right now I suppose. From hack nights, to an amazing party, to swag, to meals, to a premier conference space at a secluded resort, we&#8217;re truly trying to deliver in every way we can. It&#8217;s going to be a fantastic place to learn and connect with friends and colleagues who have truly common interests.</p></blockquote>
<p>The LoopConf team hopes to announce speakers by Wednesday of this week. Of the 28 speakers lined up, Sullivan estimates that 6 or 7 will be from outside the WordPress community, with the majority of others having spoken previously at other WordPress events.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think is important to mention is that even if these speakers have spoken at WordCamps before, it&#8217;s not likely they&#8217;ve given talks like they&#8217;ll be giving at LoopConf,&#8221; he said. <strong>&#8220;With a very developer focused audience a lot of these presenters will be able to give talks that they&#8217;re really excited about, which creates a very unique energy and environment for higher learning.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>The conference structure is also very different from what one might expect of a WordCamp. LoopConf doesn&#8217;t have a team of volunteers supporting the event but instead utilizes a paid event coordinator to manage the majority of the logistics with the venue, vendors, sponsors, etc. Sullivan expects that he and the other organizers will have a few months of working 20-30 hours per week leading up to the event.</p>
<p>Those who are unable to attend LoopConf can watch all sessions via a global live stream for free. Videos of the sessions will also be available within minutes after sessions are finished and will be offered for free to anyone who wants to learn from the event&#8217;s speakers.</p>
<p>WordPress conferences that fall under the WordCamp name have traditionally been inexpensive events, designed to bring together a local community. Because Sullivan and his team are pioneering a different event structure, they have endured a healthy amount of criticism. The team&#8217;s goal to bring in top developers from the larger community would not be possible within the confines of a traditional WordCamp.</p>
<p>Sullivan hopes that other conference organizers will also be inspired to break out of the box and host more unique events. &#8220;I would love to see more niche conferences that are WordPress specific.

<p>Mark Gibbs, who <a title=\"http://www.networkworld.com/author/Mark-Gibbs/\" href=\"http://www.networkworld.com/author/Mark-Gibbs/\">writes for NetworkWorld,</a> published an article on how <a title=\"https://ghost.org/\" href=\"https://ghost.org/\">Ghost</a> may one day <a title=\"http://www.networkworld.com/article/2845372/software/ghost-could-scare-off-wordpress-from-the-top-of-the-blogging-platforms.html\" href=\"http://www.networkworld.com/article/2845372/software/ghost-could-scare-off-wordpress-from-the-top-of-the-blogging-platforms.html\">scare WordPress off</a> as the top publishing platform. Gibbs has some valid complaints with WordPress such as, plugins that don&#8217;t integrate with the menu system in a consistent way, incompatible themes, and the post editor.</p>
<p>Although Ghost doesn&#8217;t have many of the same issues, I think it would if it was around for more than 10 years and its userbase was the size of WordPress. No software is perfect and in an open source environment, users are at the mercy of developers to provide updates to themes and plugins, an action that is not guaranteed.</p>
<h2>The Post Editor Comparison</h2>
<p>One of the most liked features of Ghost is the content editor. On the left, is the equivalent of the WordPress Text editor where you write content and can apply code via HTML or Markdown. On the right is a live preview that shows how content will look when it&#8217;s published. This single editor is like the WordPress Visual and Text editors combined.</p>
<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/GhostContentEditor.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33282]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-33283\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/GhostContentEditor.png?resize=1025%2C303\" alt=\"It\'s Like a Visual and Text Editor in One!\" /></a>It&#8217;s Like a WordPress Visual and Text Editor in One!
<p>The editor is so well liked, several plugins exist that bring it to WordPress. <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/gust-plugin-brings-the-ghost-admin-panel-into-wordpress\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/gust-plugin-brings-the-ghost-admin-panel-into-wordpress\">Gust</a>, <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/markpress-plugin-transforms-wordpress-into-a-markdown-powered-journal\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/markpress-plugin-transforms-wordpress-into-a-markdown-powered-journal\">MarkPress</a>, and <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/prettypress-plugin-reinvents-wordpress-post-editing-with-live-preview\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/prettypress-plugin-reinvents-wordpress-post-editing-with-live-preview\">PrettyPress</a> add a live preview pane to the WordPress post editor. Gibbs notes how the WordPress editor differs from Ghost, &#8220;In contrast to WordPress the &#8216;Visual&#8217; view in the editor is a simple interpretation of the HTML so you have to save and preview content to see how it’s really rendered by the currently selected theme.&#8221; While true, there is a simple way around this pitfall.</p>
<p>WordPress supports the ability for theme developers to link a custom stylesheet to the TinyMCE visual editor. It&#8217;s called <a title=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_editor_style\" href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_editor_style\">editor-style.css</a> and unfortunately, not many theme developers take advantage of this nifty feature. The stylesheet enables the visual editor to take on the look and feel of the frontend of the site, delivering a <em>what you see is what you get</em> experience. <a title=\"http://themehybrid.com/themes/stargazer\" href=\"http://themehybrid.com/themes/stargazer\">Stargazer</a> by Justin Tadlock is an excellent example of how to use editor-style.css.</p>
<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/StarGazerVisualEditorStyle.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33282]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-33284\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/StarGazerVisualEditorStyle.png?resize=964%2C652\" alt=\"The Visual Editor in Stargazer by Justin Tadlock\" /></a>The Visual Editor in Stargazer by Justin Tadlock
<p>Though the addition of editor-style.css doesn&#8217;t make the editor perfect, it vastly improves the writing experience. Having the content in the editor look the same as the final result is a huge convenience. Thanks to improved oEmbed previews <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-0-benny-now-available-for-download\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-0-benny-now-available-for-download\">in WordPress 4.0</a>, the Visual editor is the default view when I write content.</p>
<p>The Text editor still has its use, especially when a snafu occurs in the Visual editor but I think in the future, the Visual editor will improve to the point that the choice between Text and Visual will disappear. In the decisions not options approach, there will be one editor to rule them all. Between the custom stylesheet and improvements to the visual editor, I believe the writing experience in WordPress is superior to Ghost.</p>
<h2>The Ghost Dashboard</h2>
<p>One of the other highly touted features of Ghost is its beautiful, <strong>non-existent</strong> dashboard. Gibbs notes that themes and the backend of Ghost are fully responsive. A note to Gibbs that the backend of WordPress is also fully responsive. The following image from the project&#8217;s <a title=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform\" href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform\">Kickstarter page</a> was enough to convince some people to back the project.</p>
<p>To this day, Ghost doesn&#8217;t have a dashboard <a title=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/Planned-Features\" href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/Planned-Features\">but it&#8217;s coming</a>. I admit, the concept images of the dashboard are pretty, colorful, and display information in squares instead of big rectangles. The question I have is whether the actual implementation will look anything like the screenshot.</p>
<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/GhostDashboard.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33282]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-33285\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/GhostDashboard.jpg?resize=700%2C481\" alt=\"The Ghost Dashboard as Seen on its Kickstarter Page\" /></a>The Ghost Dashboard as Seen on its Kickstarter Page
<p>The WordPress Dashboard in comparison looks old but gives you the ability to arrange items the way you see fit. I&#8217;m not sure what can be done to make the dashboard <em>pretty</em>. With the eventual inclusion of the REST API to WordPress, we&#8217;ll likely see hundreds of different interpretations of not only the backend of WordPress, but the dashboard as well.</p>

<h2>The Third Party</h2>
<p>Gibbs highlights the fact that the number of third-party themes for Ghost continues to increase. Meanwhile, there are those in the WordPress community who think themes have <a title=\"http://chriswallace.net/wordpress-themes-become-commodity/\" href=\"http://chriswallace.net/wordpress-themes-become-commodity/\">become a commodity</a>. With WordPress now over 10 years old, there are plenty of free and commercial themes to choose from.</p>
<p>Ghost has a <a title=\"http://marketplace.ghost.org/\" href=\"http://marketplace.ghost.org/\">marketplace available</a> which lists free and commercial themes. The biggest difference between it and the <a title=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/\">WordPress Theme Directory</a> is the inconsistent way of displaying and locating a theme. Ghost doesn&#8217;t have an official directory to host themes. Listing themes created by the community instead of hosting them takes away the ability to create a consistent user experience.</p>
<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/GhostThemeMarketplace.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33282]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-33287\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/GhostThemeMarketplace.png?resize=1025%2C705\" alt=\"The Ghost Theme Marketplace\" /></a>The Ghost Theme Marketplace
<p>When browsing themes on the marketplace, each listing takes you to a theme&#8217;s Github page, a site using the theme, a 404 page, or somewhere else on the web. While most of the Github pages for Ghost themes display information in a consistent manner, I prefer the browsing experience on the <a title=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/\">WordPress Theme Directory</a>.</p>
<p>With the WordPress Theme Directory, I trust what I&#8217;m downloading as the code has been vetted, especially if it&#8217;s a recent addition. Information containing the version number and the average rating is consistently in the same location. The preview link is an added bonus but previews need work as they don&#8217;t always accurately render a theme.</p>

<h2>Ghost is a Long Way From Scaring WordPress</h2>
<p>Gibbs ends his article by saying, Ghost &#8220;has to be one of the most powerful and best engineered blogging platforms ever.&#8221; While I think the jury is still out on whether it&#8217;s the best engineered platform available, there is so much that goes into the success of an open source publishing system that it alone won&#8217;t propel the platform past WordPress. Ghost has the luxury of a fresh start and the opportunity to build a rock solid foundation for the platform&#8217;s future. However, it&#8217;s going to take more than that to knock WordPress off its pedestal.</p>
<p>In its current form, Ghost satisfies an audience that wants a simple, frictionless, publishing experience. Ghost delivers but without a robust third-party ecosystem, I don&#8217;t see how it will ever reach the same plateau of WordPress. That&#8217;s not to say Ghost can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t be a successful project, it&#8217;s just that I don&#8217;t see it being used on 20% of the web.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s early and Ghost has a long way to go before it hits the pivotal 1.0 milestone. The items listed on the <a title=\"https://trello.com/b/EceUgtCL/ghost-roadmap\" href=\"https://trello.com/b/EceUgtCL/ghost-roadmap\">project&#8217;s roadmap</a> indicate a lot of cool features are on the way. But for now, Ghost doesn&#8217;t have or do anything that WordPress should be afraid of.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 10 Nov 2014 19:21:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"

<p>Earlier this week, the first conference dedicated to <a title=\"http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/\" href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/\">WooCommerce</a> took place and from all accounts, it was a success. Held at <a title=\"http://969market.com/\" href=\"http://969market.com/\">969 Market</a> in San Francisco, CA, over 300 people attended <a title=\"http://conf.woocommerce.com/\" href=\"http://conf.woocommerce.com/\">WooConf </a>to learn about WooCommerce and eCommerce in general. While I didn&#8217;t attend the event, there are several people who have published their experience online.</p>

<p>In an interview on Torquemag, Mark Forrester, the co-founder of WooThemes hinted at WooConf becoming an annual event. &#8220;We’ve had loads of really positive feedback over the last couple days from a lot of the attendees (we sold out at 320 attendees) so there’s definitely good reason for a follow-up in 2015.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/beautiful-taxonomy-filters/\" target=\"_blank\">Beautiful Taxonomy Filters</a> is a new plugin that adds filtering to your custom post type archives, based on taxonomy (terms/categories/tags). It allows visitors to filter CPTs by multiple terms on the frontend.</p>
<p>The plugin automatically adds rewrite rules to create pretty filter URLs, without the use of JavaScript. Beautiful Taxonomy Filters was created by Swedish plugin developer Jonathan de Jong at the <a href=\"https://www.tigerton.se/\" target=\"_blank\">Tigerton</a> web agency. He created it using the <a href=\"https://github.com/tommcfarlin/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Plugin Boilerplate</a> in order to structure the codebase with a standardized, object-oriented approach.</p>
<p>The plugin uses <a href=\"http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/\" target=\"_blank\">select2</a> to replace ugly select boxes with attractive, user-friendly dropdowns. (If JavaScript is not supported it will fall back to the default select boxes.) Below is an example from my tests using the plugin with a standard portfolio custom post type:</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/portfolio-filters.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33229]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/portfolio-filters.jpg?resize=680%2C202\" alt=\"portfolio-filters\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33249\" /></a></p>
<p>The plugin is capable of including as many filters as you want to include. However, if you have a post type with many different taxonimies, you may want to exclude ones that aren&#8217;t as useful for filtering.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/filters.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33229]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/filters.png?resize=1025%2C578\" alt=\"filters\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33252\" /></a></p>
<p>Beautiful Taxonomy Filters includes a settings page in the admin for activating post types, easily excluding taxonomies, enabling a &#8220;clear all&#8221; link, disabling the active filters heading, changing the design, and adding custom CSS.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/settings.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33229]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/settings.jpg?resize=810%2C644\" alt=\"settings\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33256\" /></a></p>
<p>The plugin features the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Activate filtering on any registered public custom post type</li>
<li>Exclude taxonomies you don’t want visitors to filter on</li>
<li>Beautifies the resulting URLs. You won’t see any /posttype/?taxonomy1=term. Instead you’ll see /posttype/taxonomy/term</li>
<li>Includes a complete functional filter component for you to put in your theme</li>
<li>Ability to show your visitors information about their current active filtering</li>
<li>Allows for custom GET parameters to be included. Extend the filter your way with maybe a custom search-parameter or whatever you like</li>
<li>Many <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/beautiful-taxonomy-filters/other_notes/\" target=\"_blank\">filters and actions</a> for modifying the plugin&#8217;s behavior</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, Beautiful Taxonomy Filters does not support selecting multiple terms from the same taxonomy. This feature is on the roadmap. The plugin author notes that he hopes to support this in a future release and have beautiful permalinks. If the permalinks don&#8217;t work out, he plans to add an option where you can opt out of pretty permalinks in order to gain the power of multiple terms filtering.</p>
<p>Beautiful Taxonomy Filters does not support the built-in &#8220;post&#8221; post type. This is because de Jong has not yet been able to create proper rewrite rules for the multiple filtering to work, due to the fact that they are handled differently by WordPress than other CPTs. If you&#8217;re looking for filtering on regular posts, you&#8217;ll need to build that yourself, as it&#8217;s not included.</p>
<p>This plugin provides an easy way to add multiple taxonomy filters to custom post type archives. It&#8217;s convenient and easy to extend with roughly a dozen filters and actions available. I tested it and found the plugin to work as advertised.

Using Sync, you can manage plugins, themes, users, comments, view site analytics, and log files. Similar to other WordPress remote management services, you need to have the Sync plugin installed on each site you want to manage. The plugin acts as a communication bridge between Sync and the site.</p>
<p>Recently, a new feature called <a title=\"https://ithemes.com/2014/11/05/control-client-view-wordpress-dashboard-client-dashboard-ithemes-sync-pro/\" href=\"https://ithemes.com/2014/11/05/control-client-view-wordpress-dashboard-client-dashboard-ithemes-sync-pro/\">Client Dashboard</a> was added to <a title=\"https://ithemes.com/sync-pro/\" href=\"https://ithemes.com/sync-pro/\">Sync Pro</a>. With Client Dashboard, you can choose which parts of the backend are available to specific users. Hiding parts of the backend usually involves a lot of code, separate plugins, or knowing the proper permission levels for user roles. In Sync, configuring access to menus is as simple as checking a box.</p>
<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SyncClientDashboard.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33212]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-33221\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SyncClientDashboard.png?resize=1025%2C496\" alt=\"Configuring a Client Dashboard\" /></a>Configuring a Client Dashboard
<p>The following sections of the backend are able to be hidden from clients: Admin Menu, Admin Bar, Dashboard Widgets, and Admin Notices. One thing to keep in mind is that although you can hide menus, clients can still access hidden sections if they know the URL. By hiding admin notices generated by plugins, you prevent clients from accessing potentially hidden pages.</p>
<p>As part of the client dashboard, you can enable Sync Stylesheet. The Sync Stylesheet adds spacing to items in the admin menu and increases the font size making it easier to read.</p>

<p>Despite WordPress&#8217; reputation as being easy to use, it can be intimidating to first time users. Removing things they don&#8217;t need access to in the backend can significantly ease confusion and frustration.</p>

<p>I have an issue with WordPress caching plugins. It’s not that I don’t like using them, or that they’re junk (most are, but that’s a separate issue). No, the problem is that most people don’t have the foggiest idea how WordPress handles caching internally, and what causes their site to run faster.</p>
<h3>Static page caching</h3>
<p>Most caching plugins do what is called static page caching. They cache a complete page, including all of it’s HTML. This is terrific, as it means that WordPress doesn’t need to regenerate the page every time someone visits it, but it means that those pages will be out of date sometimes when content is updated. Anyone who has used these plugins can usually attest to cursing at their site due to to the cache not updating when required.</p>
<h3>Object caching</h3>
<p>For a very long time, WordPress has had a caching system baked into it. Most WordPress developers I’ve met have no idea this exists. Some have used transients, which are a part of the WordPress caching API, but in my experience, very few developers properly understand how they work.</p>
<p>By default, WordPress includes an internal caching system. If you use <code>get_option( ‘something’ );</code> somewhere in your site, then run that same code later on in that page, WordPress will only need to load the data from the database once, as it caches it for use later on in the page load. It does this via the <code>wp_cache_add()</code>, <code>wp_cache_set()</code> and <code>wp_cache_get()</code> functions.</p>
<p>Transients behave in a similar way, but by default can store the data for use in subsequent page views by storing them in the database. Storing information in the database is resource intensive though, so transients must be used sparingly to avoid hammering the database too hard and actually causing the site to slow down rather than speed up.</p>
<p>What we need is the ability to store information in a persistent way (for use on more than the current page load), which can be written to and from extremely rapidly (unlike caching in the database).</p>
<h3>Persistent object caching</h3>
<p>Although the object caching system in WordPress was designed to only work on a single page load by default, the smart folks on the WordPress core team ensured that it was trivial to plug into this and provide a way to store data however you want and for as long as you want. Awesome!</p>
<p>A normal WordPress plugin cannot be used to provide persistent object caching in WordPress. You need to manually create a drop-in file called object-cache.php, which sits in the wp-content folder. Some of the larger (bloated?) plugins, will automatically generate this drop-in file in your wp-content folder.</p>
<p>Once installed, the object caching drop-in will cache anything utilizing the WordPress caching API. This includes transients, which will automatically stop using the default database layer and instead make use of whatever object caching back-end is available.</p>
<p>Some of the earlier implementations of object-cache.php files for WordPress simply stored the data in the database, or in flat static files. But there are a multitude of better backends/places to store small pieces of data like this, and there are many different object caching drop-ins available for WordPress to hook into these various systems.</p>
<h3>In-memory data stores – ninja fast data storage</h3>
<p>MySQL is fast, but nothing compares to just throwing some data into RAM for maximum performance. With this in mind, many people who are much smarter than I, have developed systems for allowing us to store random bits of data in the server&#8217;s RAM. The most popular of these is Memcached, but there are others including APC and Redis which are very popular. Since they store their data in RAM (when possible) and are designed to be fast rather than reliable, they are insanely fast at both data storage and retrieval.</p>
<p>With a database or flat file caching back-end, you can not refresh your cache rapidly, or store tiny bits of data. With an in-memory data store, those problems do not exist. For this reason, use of an in-memory data storage back-end can provide an enormous performance advantage to sites using them in conjunction with the WordPress object caching API.</p>
<p>To make use of one of these, simply ensure that Redis, Memcached or APC are installed on your server, then install one of their corresponding drop-in files (you have to get the correct one or all hell will break loose).</p>
<ul>
<li>Memcached – <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/memcached/\" target=\"_blank\">https://wordpress.org/plugins/memcached/</a></li>
<li>Redis – <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-redis/\" target=\"_blank\">https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-redis/</a></li>
<li>APC – <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/apc/\" target=\"_blank\">https://wordpress.org/plugins/apc/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have an appropriate object caching drop-in installed, you should notice an immediate increase in performance. WordPress caches a lot of data internally and none of that will need to be queried on every page load.</p>
<p>It is entirely normal to see a stock WordPress installation go from 20+ MySQL queries per page down to 4 queries, as the object caching backend takes care of storing all of the data which does not change between page loads. The WordPress API always attempts to refresh the cache when required; there are some instances in which this does not work perfectly, but it is usually a flawless cache refreshing process.</p>
<h3>Faster static page caching</h3>
<p>There are ways to serve and refresh static page caching plugins via the WordPress object caching system too, including via the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/batcache/\" target=\"_blank\">Batcache</a> plugin, provided by the kind folks at Automattic. This is beyond the scope of this blog post, but it is worth investigating if you also require static page caching.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Caching within WordPress is complex. Object caching is a vital tool for your toolbox, as it can provide a huge performance improvement without requiring you to resort to full page caching.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Nov 2014 19:54:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"

Twitter also <a href=\"http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2014/11/06/emoji-everywhere/\" target=\"_blank\">partnered with Automattic</a> to bring emoji to WordPress.com, and users can start adding emoji to posts right away.</p>

<p>Adding emoji to content is fairly easy and intuitive when done from a mobile device. On desktop, you might need a <a href=\"http://www.iemoji.com/emoji-cheat-sheet/all\" target=\"_blank\">cheat sheet</a>. Mac users can type Command + Control + Space while in a text editor.

<p>Twitter&#8217;s announcement is major advance for emoji users worldwide, given that inconsistent emoji display across platforms has long been a sore issue.</p>
<p>The Jetpack team is already busy adding emoji support so that self-hosted sites can also utilize them.

<p><a href=\"https://github.com/lanayotech/vagrant-manager\" target=\"_blank\">Vagrant Manager</a> is a new tool for OS X that gives you a UI for managing all of your virtual machines in one place, no matter what kind of Vagrant configuration(s) you have running. Its convenient toolbar gives you access to all your VMs with the ability to execute commands.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/vagrant-manager.gif\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33022]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/vagrant-manager.gif?resize=940%2C523\" alt=\"vagrant-manager\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33144\" /></a></p>
<p>Vagrant Manager&#8217;s primary features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Indicators for running/halted VM&#8217;s:</strong> on (green), off (red), suspended (orange)</li>
<li><strong>Execute vagrant commands:</strong> hover over a VM and select a command from the dropdown</li>
<li><strong>Customization options available through the preferences pane:</strong> set preferences for launch, how VMs are displayed, refresh interval, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Machine Support:</strong> run actions against one machine or all of them at once</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding Vagrant Manager is actually much easier than setting up a new Vagrant configuration. After you download it, Vagrant Manager automatically detects VirtualBox and Parallels machines. Any vagrant machines that you want it to detect must already be initialized. If you don&#8217;t see a machine in the list, simply run <code>vagrant init</code> on it. Machines will disappear from your list once destroyed, so you might want to add a bookmark in Vagrant Manager for quick access later.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/vagrant-manager.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33022]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/vagrant-manager.png?resize=1025%2C575\" alt=\"vagrant-manager\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33102\" /></a></p>
<p>The preferences pane lets you select your Terminal preference, change the icon theme for the status bar, launch at login, and show/hide various counts/notifications.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/preferences.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33022]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/preferences.png?resize=900%2C953\" alt=\"preferences\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33151\" /></a></p>
<p>Certainly, you don&#8217;t <em>need</em> a UI for managing your VMs, but it gives you a nice visual overview of all your machines in one centralized place. If you&#8217;re like me, and you constantly forget which machines you have running, this utility is a convenient addition to your menu bar.

<p>Matt Mullenweg announced today at <a href=\"http://websummit.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Web Summit in Dublin</a> that Automattic has acquired <a href=\"http://codeforthepeople.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Code for the People</a>, a UK-based WordPress development agency and longtime WordPress.com VIP partner. The acquisition adds all six members of the company, including co-founders Simon Dickson and Simon Wheatley, to the WordPress.com VIP team.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fairly natural transition for us,&#8221; Dickson told the Tavern. &#8220;We were part of Automattic&#8217;s VIP Featured Partner program from day one &#8211; so we&#8217;ve known a lot of these people for literally years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Code for the People (CFTP) began talking to Automattic in the spring of this year on a very informal basis, but once the team decided it was a realistic prospect, things started to speed up. In joining the VIP team, CFTP will say goodbye to their days of designing and developing websites.</p>
<p>Dickson anticipates that they will be joining in with what the VIP team is already doing, except in European hours. &#8220;The team exists to provide expertise and products to support the world&#8217;s biggest publishers, whether that&#8217;s on WordPress.com or self-hosted systems,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As new Automattic employees, the team will help to expand VIP&#8217;s reach into the European market. <strong>&#8220;We&#8217;re looking forward to bringing an additional perspective to the team, based on our own experiences on the front line, and in the European market,&#8221;</strong> Dickson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Personally, I&#8217;ll be looking for ways to help develop the European ecosystem. It was something we talked about in Sofia: a lot of WP agencies would like some kind of network, formal or informal, to share ideas and experiences. I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;s something I can do as part of my new role.&#8221;</p>
<p>The acquisition includes CFTP&#8217;s <a href=\"http://babbleplugin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Babble</a> plugin, an open source multilingual tool that Mullenweg counted as one of the key parts of the deal, according to <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/06/automattic-buys-uks-code-for-the-people-to-build-out-its-wordpress-vip-enterprise-business/\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch</a>. Babble will continue to be maintained by Automattic, the details of which are still being fleshed out.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been really encouraged by the prominence of the multilingual question in recent weeks and months,&#8221; Dickson said. &#8220;It&#8217;s an area where we know WordPress needs to do better; and it&#8217;s been great to see people recognizing Babble as, potentially, the most core-friendly way of answering it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Code for the People is a company that was built on the principle of giving back to open source platforms. with employees regularly contributing to WordPress core. At the end of September it was announced that CFTP developer <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/meet-john-blackbourn-wordpress-4-1-release-lead\" target=\"_blank\">John Blackbourn would be leading WordPress 4.1</a>, a commitment the company made long before the acquisition deal was sealed.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;We felt it was important for a small team, even as small as ours, to stand up and say yes &#8211; the future of WordPress is that important to us,&#8221;</strong> Dickson said. Blackbourn will continue leading the release as an Automattic employee.</p>
<p>The founders of CFTP never set out to get acquired. &#8220;Genuinely, we formed Code For The People as a means to an end. We wanted to support each other’s efforts to do interesting things with WordPress, and to make WordPress better as a result,&#8221; Dickson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Building a successful business was a happy bi-product of that, but it was never the primary motivation. We chose the name Code For The People very deliberately. It was always there to keep us honest, and ensure we stayed true to our mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bittersweet day as CFTP bids goodbye to many of their clients and the brand they worked to build. Dickson hopes to bring that same dedication to VIP clients at Automattic with a focus on expanding its services in Europe.</p>
<p>The Code for the People brand will be retired. If you check out the farewell message on the company&#8217;s <a href=\"http://codeforthepeople.com\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, you&#8217;ll notice that it was built using <a href=\"http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/ever-after/\" target=\"_blank\">Ever After</a>, a wedding theme by WordPress.com. Although the team is giving up the strong brand name they&#8217;ve created, they hope to carry on their shared love of open source software as employees of Automattic.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 06 Nov 2014 19:22:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"

<p>One of the most difficult parts of running a WordPress business is coming up with a revenue strategy. In a <a title=\"http://www.sidekick.pro/blog/updates/pricing-answers/\" href=\"http://www.sidekick.pro/blog/updates/pricing-answers/\">post on the official SIDEKICK blog</a>, Ben Fox explains that in the past two weeks, customers went through a pricing experiment with an opportunity to provide feedback. The feedback to SIDEKICK highlighted areas ripe for improvement including pricing, the number of plans, and determining value.</p>
<p>One of the biggest lessons learned from the article is to base a price on value, not on cost.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our biggest mistake when we started discussing price was trying to determine what it would cost us to support our platform and each customer, not what the value of our platform was to our customers. When you price based on cost, you leave money on the table. When you price based on value, everybody wins.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m happy to see SIDEKICK stick by its instincts after receiving the following feedback, &#8220;SaaS has no place in WordPress” and “I will only ever pay a flat fee for a plugin.” If SIDEKICK restructured its plans to cater to this mindset, they&#8217;ll almost certainly go out of business. Fox points out three things that would happen if SIDEKICK accepted a one-time flat fee and unlimited updates.</p>
<ol>
<li>We would never see a return on our investment and our customers would never see the value they’ve paid for</li>
<li>The quality of our product would never really improve because we couldn’t afford to add new features or do much more than bug fix</li>
<li>Our prices would go up exponentially because we would need to make sure we’re covering the lifetime COSTS of a customer. Not a smart way to do business.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#8217;s <a title=\"http://mattreport.com/pricing-wordpress-product/\" href=\"http://mattreport.com/pricing-wordpress-product/\">been said before</a> and bears repeating, &#8220;the days of low-priced plugins and unlimited everything are going by the way side.&#8221; WordPress product businesses that operate with unlimited anything are almost certain to fail as it&#8217;s an unsustainable model. Customers need to realize this sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>If pricing is something you&#8217;re having trouble with in your business, Chris Lema has written a series of posts you can read for free on the <a title=\"http://chrislema.com/tag/pricing/\" href=\"http://chrislema.com/tag/pricing/\">topic of pricing</a>. If you want something more in-depth, consider purchasing and reading <a title=\"http://chrislema.com/store/price-right-introduction-product-pricing/\" href=\"http://chrislema.com/store/price-right-introduction-product-pricing/\">The Price is Right</a> by Chris Lema. Matt Medeiros of <a title=\"http://mattreport.com/\" href=\"http://mattreport.com/\">MattReport.com</a> also has a lot of content on pricing and general business practices.</p>
<p>I appreciate the transparency Fox offered regarding SIDEKICK&#8217;s pricing structure and the reasons behind it. It would be nice to see more companies share the lessons they&#8217;ve learned in the pricing game. By sharing knowledge, everyone in the WordPress ecosystem wins.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 06 Nov 2014 02:45:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"

<p>The company used GitHub pages to create a <a href=\"http://10up.github.io/Engineering-Best-Practices/\" target=\"_blank\">website featuring best practices</a> for tools, project structure, version control, PHP, and JavaScript.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10up-best-practices.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33026]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10up-best-practices.png?resize=1025%2C848\" alt=\"10up-best-practices\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33070\" /></a></p>
<p>10up&#8217;s best practices were created in an effort to standardize the company&#8217;s tools, frameworks, libraries, style, version control, etc., for its employees. <strong>&#8220;Standardization in engineering is increasingly important with such a large team. Over the past few months we collaborated as a company to document how we engineer and why,&#8221;</strong> Lovett said. The result is a concise public reference for 10up&#8217;s 90+ full time employees and anyone else who is interested.</p>
<p>This collection of best practices and tools makes it easier for new employees to jump on board and be ready for efficient collaboration with others in the company. The in-depth guide covers everything from efficient database queries, data storage, namespacing, and security, to helpful tools for local development, dependency management, and version control.</p>
<p>Although the page&#8217;s description emphasizes that the content is not geared to teach anyone to become an engineer, the best practices site is undoubtedly a valuable learning resource. If you&#8217;re new to WordPress development, the site will give you an idea of the kinds of tools that a top agency uses in order to work more efficiently.</p>
<p>The team at 10up hopes that the <a href=\"http://10up.github.io/Engineering-Best-Practices/\" target=\"_blank\">best practices website</a> will also help to influence community members. The site states that company is willing to evolve the best practices through contributions and invites folks from the community to contribute to the site&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/Engineering-Best-Practices\" target=\"_blank\">repository on GitHub</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Nov 2014 23:39:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"

<p>Joseph Herbrandson of <a title=\"https://sucuri.net/\" href=\"https://sucuri.net/\">Sucuri </a>published an <a title=\"http://blog.sucuri.net/2014/11/most-common-attacks-affecting-todays-websites.html\" href=\"http://blog.sucuri.net/2014/11/most-common-attacks-affecting-todays-websites.html\">excellent article</a> listing the most common attacks today&#8217;s websites are facing. Herbrandson does a good job of explaining the attacks without inundating the reader with technical jargon. He also links to WordPress items that are relevant to each type of attack.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spoken to Herbrandson at a few different WordCamps and one question I&#8217;ve asked him is &#8220;what does this all mean to the average user?&#8221; He answers the question in his post:</p>
<blockquote><p>All software, old and new, follows the same concepts that made computers work decades prior to now. The only difference today is the number of complex layers that have been added to make the process seem confusing.</p>
<p>The only ones confused though, are the people for whom the complexity was implemented to protect in the first place: <strong>the users</strong>. The continuous pattern of cyber-assault on everything from banks to bakeries, and across the board from Target to Apple, is showing that this world requires users to break the expectation of confusion and understand how Internet instigators are really coming after us.</p></blockquote>
<p>Herbrandson and others in the field have the difficult task of informing the public without scaring it. I&#8217;ve sat in sessions at WordCamps where he educates users on website security and most of the attendees realize they have to take website security seriously. There&#8217;s only been a few times where attendees have become scared, but it&#8217;s good to be scared.</p>
<p>However, a poor reaction to being scared is to install several different security focused plugins thinking you&#8217;ll be protected from every threat. In most cases, this will end up doing more harm than good as plugins lock down potentially useful features such as XML-RPC. I&#8217;m all for securing websites, but I also believe in such a thing as <em>too much security</em>. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s no such thing as a silver bullet to protect against every threat without being an inconvenience in some way.</p>
<p>Definitely <a title=\"http://blog.sucuri.net/2014/11/most-common-attacks-affecting-todays-websites.html\" href=\"http://blog.sucuri.net/2014/11/most-common-attacks-affecting-todays-websites.html\">check out his article</a> and consider the questions asked at the bottom of the post. If you&#8217;ve never seen Herbrandson present on WordPress security fundamentals, here is a recorded presentation from WordCamp Orange County 2014. In the session, he covers simple principles everyone can implement to keep the risk of attacks as low as possible.</p>

<p>Entry level WordPress debugging often involves the tedious task of turning plugins on and off to track down the culprit that is breaking something on your site. When seeking help in support forums, users are often instructed to deactivate all of their plugins and activate one of the default themes.</p>
<p>This process can become especially complicated when you have, for example, 55 plugins active, 10 inactive, and 4 recently active. Trying to remember which ones were previously active/inactive is maddening, especially if you&#8217;re new to the site and not aware of where and how the plugins are in use.</p>
<p><a title=\"Bulk Deactivate \" href=\"http://raison.co/bulk-deactivate/\" target=\"_blank\">Bulk Deactivate</a> is a new WordPress debugging tool that offers advanced options for saving your plugin list. After attending WordCamp Europe, the folks at <a href=\"http://raison.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Raison</a>, a WordPress development agency, decided to open source the plugin as part of their contribution towards the <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2014/09/five-for-the-future/\" target=\"_blank\">Five for the Future</a> initiative.</p>
<p>Bulk Deactivate sets up shop under the Plugins menu in the admin and allows for tailoring exceptions via a dropdown select list of your active plugins.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/bulk-deactivate.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33025]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33033\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/bulk-deactivate.jpg?resize=925%2C586\" alt=\"bulk-deactivate\" /></a></p>
<p>Ordinarily, after doing a bulk plugin deactivation, all your inactive plugins are lumped together. When using the Bulk Deactivate plugin as an alternative, you&#8217;ll get a saved list of the plugins that you just deactivated so you can easily re-activate them all again.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/activate-saved-plugins.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33025]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33042\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/activate-saved-plugins.jpg?resize=828%2C408\" alt=\"activate-saved-plugins\" /></a></p>
<p>Bulk Deactivate is not an all-or-nothing plugin. It can be configured a number of different ways to suit your particular debugging requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add exceptions, so essential plugins will not be deactivated</li>
<li>Save a list of the plugins deactivated</li>
<li>Activate the plugins you just deactivated</li>
<li>Activate only a selection of the plugins just deactivated</li>
<li>Advanced options for how the plugin save list is handled</li>
</ul>
<p>The next time you have to take up the task of isolating a plugin conflict, you might want to employ the help of the Bulk Deactivate plugin. I tested it and found it to work exactly as expected.

<p>Choosing a webhost is an <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/14-things-to-consider-when-choosing-a-webhost-for-your-wordpress-powered-site\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/14-things-to-consider-when-choosing-a-webhost-for-your-wordpress-powered-site\">important but difficult decision</a>, especially when a lot of reviews contain questionable content with affiliate links. It&#8217;s hard to find non-biased information such as real experiences customers have had with a company. One reliable source of information is the <a title=\"http://wpshout.com/wordpress-hosting-review-2014-results/\" href=\"http://wpshout.com/wordpress-hosting-review-2014-results/\">WPShout webhosting survey</a>.</p>
<p>Despite a goal of 500, only 159 people responded to the survey. Although it&#8217;s not a large data set, it provides enough information to get a feel for the webhosting scene in the WordPress ecosystem. The survey collected data in seven areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Average satisfaction</li>
<li>Value</li>
<li>Reliability</li>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Support</li>
<li>Median site count</li>
<li>Usability</li>
<li>WordPress compatibility</li>
</ol>
<p>Each respondent was asked to provide an overall impression between 1-10 to each area with an option to provide a text comment. Monthly cost of a plan, number of sites hosted on the plan, and monthly traffic to hosted sites was also collected.</p>
<h2>The Pricing Valley</h2>
<p>One of the data points I find interesting is the graph showing customer experience by monthly cost. Those who use the cheapest hosting plans $0-$5 have the worst experience overall. Those who use plans in the $6-$15 range show a significantly higher satisfaction rate across the board. The customer experience level drops off with plans in the $16-$49 range.</p>
<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/CustomerSatisfactionLevels.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33003]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-33004\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/CustomerSatisfactionLevels.png?resize=866%2C580\" alt=\"Customer Satisfaction Levels\" /></a>Overall Satisfaction Levels Based on Monthly Cost
<p>I&#8217;m surprised by this statistic since several of the managed WordPress hosting plans are in this price range. I expect customers to be the most satisfied with these plans since the service is catered to hosting WordPress sites. The results prove this isn&#8217;t the case and managed WordPress hosting providers have room for improvement. Customer satisfaction gradually rises with those who use plans that are $50 or more. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s any surprise that the saying &#8220;you get what you pay for&#8221; applies to the webhosting industry.</p>
<h2>Small or Specialty Webhosts Ranked Well</h2>
<p>The results indicate smaller webhosting companies are not only agile in serving customer needs, they&#8217;re likely to provide an exceptional level of support. These types of companies fit into a mid-level tier of cost and popularity. Examples include <a title=\"https://getflywheel.com/\" href=\"https://getflywheel.com/\">Flywheel</a> and <a title=\"http://asmallorange.com/\" href=\"http://asmallorange.com/\">A Small Orange</a>. <a title=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/\">Digital Ocean</a> also has a good showing with high rankings across the board.</p>
<p>Established, large hosting companies such as <a title=\"https://www.dreamhost.com/\" href=\"https://www.dreamhost.com/\">Dreamhost</a> and <a title=\"http://mediatemple.net/\" href=\"http://mediatemple.net/\">Media Temple</a>, have less than stellar ratings. Comment feedback indicates Dreamhost needs to improve not only its tech support, but reliability across the board. &#8220;I’ve liked Dreamhost in the past, but it seems the speed becomes slower each year, the servers become less reliable, and the support less helpful.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Things to Keep in Mind</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s important to keep in mind that ratings and averages for some webhosting companies in the survey are based on 2-5 responses. The data should not be used by itself to make decisions on which company to host a site with. Instead, use the data in combination with several other sources of information such as recommendations, personal research, and non-affiliated reviews.</p>
<p>I encourage you to <a title=\"http://wpshout.com/wordpress-hosting-review-2014-results/\" href=\"http://wpshout.com/wordpress-hosting-review-2014-results/\">review the results</a> and if you want access to the raw survey data, <a title=\"contact@wpshout.com\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/contact@wpshout.com\">send a request</a> to WPShout.

<p>WordPress 4.1 will be adding several major improvements for theme developers. Joost de Valk opened a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18548\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> three years ago, requesting a better option for controlling the output of title tags. He proposed a patch that would output the title tag during the run of wp_head, based on whether the current theme has added theme_support. This implementation is finally gaining traction, after a great deal of discussion among WordPress contributors.</p>
<p>This week <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/meet-john-blackbourn-wordpress-4-1-release-lead\" target=\"_blank\">John Blackbourn</a>, the lead for WordPress 4.1, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/30074\" target=\"_blank\">committed</a> a forward-compatible way for allowing plugin and theme authors to better customize the output of document titles.  The upcoming release will introduce theme support for the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Title_Tag\" target=\"_blank\">title tag</a>.</p>
<pre class=\"brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate\">add_theme_support( \'title-tag\' );</pre>
<p><strong>&#8220;By declaring support like this, themes acknowledge that they are not defining titles on their own and WordPress can add it safely without duplication,&#8221;</strong> core contributor Konstantin Obenland explained when outlining title tag support in his most recent <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/10/29/title-tags-in-4-1/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> to the make/core blog.</p>
<p>He elaborated further on the three year long effort, saying that it also served to correct an ancient practice of Kubrick, which appended the the blog name to <code>wp_title()</code>:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate\">&lt;title&gt;&lt;?php wp_title(\'&amp;laquo;\', true, \'right\'); ?&gt; &lt;?php bloginfo(\'name\'); ?&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</pre>
<p>That practice became fairly standard in WordPress themes. The new theme support for the title tag will make it easier for plugins and themes to manage the document title.</p>
<h3>New Template Functions for Archive Title and Descriptions</h3>
<p>WordPress 4.1 also introduces a couple of <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/30223\" target=\"_blank\">new template functions</a> for archive titles and descriptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>get_the_archive_title()</code> and <code>the_archive_title()</code> for returning/displaying the title of the current term, date, post type, post format, or author archive.</li>
<li><code>get_the_archive_description()</code> and <code>the_archive_description()</code> for returning/displaying the description associated with the current term archive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Developers will have these new functions at their disposal, thanks to efforts from Konstantin Obenland and Drew Jaynes.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in the business building WordPress themes, you will want to take note of how to use the new title tag with backwards compatibility, as <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/10/29/title-tags-in-4-1/\" target=\"_blank\">outlined</a> by Obenland.</p>
<p>At this time, plugin developers are discouraged from building functionality around theme support for title tags. <strong>&#8220;The long term plan is to enable users to manage document titles from their admin, independent of which theme they’re using,&#8221;</strong> Obenland explained. Changes in WordPress 4.1 are the first step towards making title tags more plugin friendly.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 04 Nov 2014 21:36:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"

<p>The third annual <a title=\"http://wordsesh.org/\" href=\"http://wordsesh.org/\">WordSesh</a> will take place on December 20th, 2014 at UTC+0. Organized by <a title=\"http://scottbasgaard.com/\" href=\"http://scottbasgaard.com/\">Scott Basgaard</a>, WordSesh is like a virtual WordCamp except there is one session per hour for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Unlike <a title=\"http://second.wordsesh.org/\" href=\"http://second.wordsesh.org/\">WordSesh 2</a>, this year&#8217;s event will have one track instead of two. As in previous years, it will be free to attend. The decision to only have one track is based on feedback from WordSesh 2 attendees. &#8220;While WS2 was “bigger and better” it felt a bit unorganized and I’d like to capture having everyone in one place again,&#8221; Basgaard told the Tavern.</p>
<p>Basgaard is inviting specific individuals to speak at the event. The remaining slots will open to the public where speakers will be hand-picked. Sessions will be split into five categories with 3-4 sessions per category followed by a round table discussion. <a title=\"http://dradcast.com/\" href=\"http://dradcast.com/\">DradCast</a> will once again kick off the event in what has become part of the tradition. Basgaard sent the Tavern a tentative look at the schedule that includes the following categories: Business, Users, Themes, Plugins, and Community.</p>
<h2>WordSesh is a Popular Event</h2>
<p>Over 3,000 unique viewers from 85 different countries <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/wordsesh-recap-global-wordpress-event-pulls-3000-unique-viewers-from-85-countries\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordsesh-recap-global-wordpress-event-pulls-3000-unique-viewers-from-85-countries\">watched WordSesh 2</a>. Attendance for the event far exceeded that of most WordCamps. WordSesh 2 organizers shared some of their viewership stats on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wordsesh\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and the results demonstrate that the event was a hit all over the world:</p>
<ul>
<li>The city of Sofia, Bulgaria, had the most viewers of any city in the world, followed by London and New york.</li>
<li>36 unique viewers from Africa</li>
<li>98 unique viewers from Oceania</li>
<li>120 unique viewers from Asia</li>
<li>843 unique viewers from Europe</li>
<li>1,404 unique viewers from North / South America</li>
<li>3,000 unique viewers over 85 countries</li>
</ul>

Plugin branding has made exploring the 34,000+ items in the official <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/\" target=\"_blank\">Plugin Directory</a> a more friendly and colorful experience for users.</p>
<p>Building on top of the new plugin identity cards, French WordPress developer <a href=\"http://b-website.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Brice Capobianco</a> created <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-plugin-info-card/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Plugin Info Card</a> for showcasing plugins on the frontend of a site. This new plugin uses the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress.org_API\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.org plugin API</a> to fetch data and provides a configurable shortcode for embedding plugin cards within your content.</p>
<p>By default, the front of each card displays the plugin&#8217;s logo, author, ratings, downloads, and WordPress version required. The logo links to the plugin&#8217;s page on WordPress.org.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/plugin-info-cards.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[32894]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/plugin-info-cards.png?resize=1025%2C503\" alt=\"plugin-info-cards\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32909\" /></a></p>
<p>If you click on the &#8220;Download&#8221; section at the bottom, the card is flipped using a smooth rotation effect, allowing you to download the zip file for the plugin.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/plugin-info-card-back-view.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[32894]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/plugin-info-card-back-view.png?resize=1025%2C499\" alt=\"plugin-info-card-back-view\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32941\" /></a></p>
<p>Check out a <a href=\"http://b-website.com/wp-plugin-info-card-for-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">live demo</a> to see the cards with the rotation feature.</p>
<p>Capobianco created the plugin to be lightweight. It will only include the scripts and CSS if and when required. WP Plugin Info Cards also uses WordPress transients to store data returned by the API for 10 minutes. This means that your page load won&#8217;t be slowed down by requests for the plugin data.</p>
<p>The plugin also includes a dashboard widget that can be set up by adding plugin slugs for the extensions you want to include. It&#8217;s easy to reorder via drag-and-drop.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/dashboard-widget-plugin-info.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[32894]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/dashboard-widget-plugin-info.jpg?resize=699%2C552\" alt=\"dashboard-widget-plugin-info\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32946\" /></a></p>
<p>The dashboard widget feature seems less useful than the shortcode, unless you are intent on monitoring specific plugin stats in a list. The shortcode, however, has a whole host of parameters for customizing the frontend display:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>slug:</strong> plugin slug name</li>
<li><strong>image:</strong> image url to replace WP logo (default: empty)</li>
<li><strong>logo:</strong> 128&#215;128.jpg, 256&#215;256.jpg, 128&#215;128.png, 256&#215;256.png, svg, no (default: svg)</li>
<li><strong>banner:</strong> jpg, png, no (default:empty)</li>
<li><strong>align:</strong> center, left, right (default: empty)</li>
<li><strong>containerid:</strong> custom div id, may be used for anchor (default: wp-pic-PLUGIN-NAME)</li>
<li><strong>margin:</strong> custom container margin &#8211; eg: &#8220;15px 0&#8243; (default: empty)</li>
<li><strong>clear:</strong> clear float before or after the card: before, after (default: empty)</li>
<li><strong>custom:</strong> value to output : url, name, version, author, requires, rating, num_ratings, downloaded, last_updated, download_link (default: empty)</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that Capobianco put quite a bit of effort into the plugin to ensure that its users could customize it for their own unique uses. The examples shown above were created using just the basic shortcode for each plugin:</p>
<p><code>[wp-pic slug=\"buddypress\"]</code></p>
<p>WP Plugin Info Cards makes it easy to quickly create a list of your favorite plugins. You could also use it to showcase your own plugins or to create a list of plugins that you personally endorse. If you&#8217;re writing a guide or tutorial that requires the use of a collection of plugins, you could use WP Plugin Info Cards to easily build that list with download links for each. The next time you need to create a visual list of plugins in your content, download <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-plugin-info-card/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Plugin Info Cards</a> from WordPress.org.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 04 Nov 2014 19:47:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"

<p>One of the <a title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/focus/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/focus/\">feature plugins</a> under development for possible inclusion to WordPress 4.1 is called <a title=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29806\" href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29806\">Focus</a>. Focus enhances the Distraction Free Writing mode in WordPress. Janneke Van Dorpe is the lead developer for the project with Mark Jaquith and Andrew Ozz contributing as well. Unlike DFW mode in WordPress 4.0, Focus keeps the meta boxes, admin bar, and left hand menu just a mouse swipe away from view.</p>
<a href=\"http://wptavern.com/how-the-focus-project-plans-to-enhance-distraction-free-writing-in-wordpress#gallery-32888-1-slideshow\">Click to view slideshow.</a>
<p>Although the interface surrounding the editor disappears, users can access the admin bar without the surrounding interface showing up. The admin bar and meta boxes below and to the right of the post editor fade away while the menu on the left moves out of view. I don&#8217;t find the animation to be distracting and the menus come back into view quickly.</p>
<p>According to Jaquith, Distraction Free Writing in WordPress has a few issues. He outlines three primary reasons for the changes.</p>
<ol>
<li>The transition to and from it is distracting. It&#8217;s a separate editor and it makes you lose your place.</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t have access to the same editing tools, so you would feel like you had to keep switching back and forth.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s not very discoverable in the first place.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class=\"message_content\">&#8220;Combine those things, and it just wasn&#8217;t compelling. Now, it engages when you type (fixing discoverability), its transition is seamless, but you still have instant access to all the same editing tools and all your regular meta boxes. It&#8217;s the best of both worlds,&#8221; Jaquith told the Tavern. </span></p>
<p>I rarely use DFW mode in WordPress but after using the Focus plugin, I&#8217;m willing to give it a try. I like the fact that meta boxes and the menu are quickly accessible despite being hidden.</p>
<h2>Needs Approval</h2>
<p>John Blackbourn, who is <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/meet-john-blackbourn-wordpress-4-1-release-lead\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/meet-john-blackbourn-wordpress-4-1-release-lead\">leading the release</a> of WordPress 4.1, has to determine whether the project is at a point where it can be merged into core. If it&#8217;s approved, those who update to WordPress 4.1 will see the enhancements currently in the Focus plugin. Once it&#8217;s merged into core, the plan is to use a <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/create-your-own-custom-pointers-in-the-wordpress-admin\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/create-your-own-custom-pointers-in-the-wordpress-admin\">feature pointer</a> to let users know of its existence.</p>
<p>Since disabling DFW mode is as easy as pressing a button in the editor, this is a calculated risk. People who see the editor for the first time might make it their primary means of writing content. This in turn would lead to more users and possible improvements down the road. Even with using a feature pointer, I&#8217;m curious to see how users react to it being enabled after updating to WordPress 4.1.</p>
<h2>How to Contribute to Focus</h2>

Today the Jetpack team officially <a href=\"http://jetpack.me/2014/11/03/jetpack-3-2/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the release, along with a new feature that wasn&#8217;t mentioned in the changelog.</p>
<h2>Centralized Posting from WordPress.com</h2>
<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/centralized-posting.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[32841]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32854\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/centralized-posting.png?resize=700%2C316\" alt=\"centralized-posting\" /></a></p>
<p>Self-hosted WordPress sites connected via Jetpack can now publish posts using the WordPress.com post editor. When you visit <a title=\"WordPress.com Post Editor\" href=\"http://wordpress.com/post/\" target=\"_blank\">wordpress.com/post/</a> you&#8217;ll find a dropdown of your sites above the title field. Here you can select a Jetpack-connected site. Once you either save or publish a post, a progress bar crawls across the screen as WordPress.com communicates to your site.</p>
<p>On first look, it seems that WordPress.com is aiming to become a centralized place for publishing WordPress content, regardless of where the site is hosted.</p>
<p>But this begs the question: <strong>Why would I want to post to my self-hosted site from WordPress.com?</strong> Many themes now incorporate customized editor styles to help match the preview to the frontend a little better. The self-hosted post editor also includes better access to the rest of your content and integration with plugins you&#8217;ve added to customize that experience.</p>
<h3>The Idea Behind Centralizing Posting from WordPress.com</h3>
<p>I spoke with Jetpack team member <a href=\"http://stephanis.info/\" target=\"_blank\">George Stephanis</a> regarding the idea and direction behind the new centralized publishing option. He identified a number of complementary purposes for the new feature. &#8220;One is to dogfood the <a title=\"WordPress.com REST API\" href=\"http://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.com REST API</a>,&#8221; he said. &#8220;By using the REST API instead of the traditional wp-admin means, we can ensure we&#8217;ve covered edge cases in usage and that it&#8217;s appropriate for production usage.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also sees the new posting option as a convenient way to get quick access to any of your sites. &#8220;Another purpose is for users that have fifty sites, and just want to throw quick thoughts up,&#8221; Stephanis said. When you have that many sites, accessing one through WordPress.com can be easier than going to the self-hosted admin and authenticating.</p>
<p>However, he recognizes that centralized publishing is not necessarily beneficial for every site. &#8220;In-depth posts to customized installs will naturally have a better experience going right to their customized wp-admin editor.&#8221;</p>
<p>After testing, I can confirm that it is fully functional for remote publishing, although it leaves somewhat of a disconnect between writing and seeing the live content. If you publish content, chances are that you want to visit your site anyway to see it live. Unless you&#8217;re simply saving a quick draft to your site, remote publishing doesn&#8217;t yet appear to have many advantages apart from convenience.</p>
<h3>Experimenting with the WordPress Admin</h3>
<p>The centralized publishing experience is just a first step, Stephanis said. The Jetpack team has more planned. &#8220;There&#8217;s more iterations and ways of managing and writing content that we can slip in more comfortably to the new WordPress.com editor, specifically as it doesn&#8217;t have to support a lot of the old metaboxes and custom stuff that wp-admin has,&#8221; he explained. <strong>&#8220;So it&#8217;s a way to safely iterate, while still maintaining the old wp-admin side.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>The upcoming <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-api\" target=\"_blank\">WP REST API</a> for WordPress core, along with ongoing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/press-this/\" target=\"_blank\">experiments with the Press This feature</a>, will open up many more opportunities for developers to publish to WordPress without using the traditional admin at all. The folks at WordPress.com are experimenting with their own REST API and Stephanis said he is &#8220;eager to see the external APIs converge, as there’s a lot that both current implementations can gain from the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>Centralized publishing isn&#8217;t the first WordPress.com REST API experiment. The <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/automattic-introduces-postbot-app-for-scheduling-photo-posts\" target=\"_blank\">Postbot app</a> introduced users to the possibility of publishing images without the admin. The WordPress.com API team also created <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/2014/05/20/meet-sulfur/\" target=\"_blank\">Sulfer</a>, an open source media manager app built in JavaScript, using the API.</p>
<p>How long before the &#8220;old&#8221; WordPress admin is obsolete? &#8220;The old wp-admin is never going away, from WordPress.com or self-hosted,&#8221; Stephanis said. &#8220;But in the world of API driven development, this is a big step forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;By ensuring that our WordPress.com Editor can post comfortably to self-hosted sites and WordPress.com sites, that also ensures that third party clients can operate more confidently and that some of the odd quirks and edge cases have been ironed out already.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you want to see the WordPress.com REST API in action, simply log into your account and post to one of your Jetpack-connected sites. Do you think you&#8217;ll use this feature often? Given that it&#8217;s only the first version, how do you think it could be improved to better support self-hosted publishers?</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 03 Nov 2014 20:35:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"

<p>This update fixes a bug that could have prevented old spam comments from being deleted, and it gives you more control over how Akismet deletes old spam comments: the maximum age and number per batch are both <a href=\"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/akismet/trunk/class.akismet.php?rev=1003398#L259\">filterable</a>.  You can also <a href=\"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/akismet/trunk/class.akismet.php?rev=987350#L932\">disable Akismet&#8217;s debug logging</a> even if you have <code>WP_DEBUG</code> enabled. Lastly, we&#8217;ve removed the &#8220;Check for Spam&#8221; button from the Spam folder; that just seemed reasonable.</p>
<p>To upgrade, visit the Updates page of your WordPress dashboard and follow the instructions.

While in <a href=\"http://blog.akismet.com/2014/10/01/september-stats-roundup/\">September</a> we hit and surpassed the 300-million spam messages per day milestone, in October we saw over <strong>400 million spam messages come through per day</strong> on 12 different days.</p>
<p>Here are the daily stats:</p>
<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1733\" src=\"https://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/akismet-spam-and-ham-stats-october-2014.png?w=700&h=436\" alt=\"akismet-spam-and-ham-stats-october-2014\" /></p>
<p>There was a rise of 44% in the number of spam comments caught from last month, and a 185% rise from last year in October.</p>
<p>In total, <strong>Akismet caught 11,337,365,500 spam messages this month</strong>, and 207,939,000 ham messages. As usual, the amount of legitimate messages going around is much less than spam &#8211; coming in at 1.8% this month.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_1734\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"wp-image-1734 size-medium\" src=\"https://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/tellurian.jpg?w=300&h=119\" alt=\"Tellurian\" width=\"300\" height=\"119\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is an image from page 390 of &#8220;School funds and school laws of Michigan: with notes and forms&#8221; (1859) published by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/internetarchivebookimages/\">Internet Archive Book Images</a></p></div>
<p>To help visualize the numbers, picture a trip from the Earth to the sun. It is 150 million kilometres long on average (that&#8217;s approximately 93 million miles). <strong>If each kilometre represents one spam comment, it would take 75 trips to the sun to account for all the spam comments Akismet saw this month</strong>. On the other hand, if each legitimate comment were one kilometre, it would make up only one trip and a third.</p>
<p>The busiest day for spam for Akismet this month was the 29th, with over 482 million spam comments caught. The slowest day was the 12th (coming in at only 273 million).</p>
<p>Akismet missed only about 1 in every 11,475 spam comments this month. Your own blog&#8217;s spam comments may have followed similar rises and falls, and seen some missed spam comments. Please mark those missed comments as spam so that Akismet can learn from your feedback. If you notice a large number of spam comments coming through uncaught by Akismet, please <a href=\"http://akismet.com/contact/\">contact us</a> and we&#8217;ll be glad to help.</p>

A majority of the improvements found in this release center around enhancing <a href=\"http://en.support.wordpress.com/reader/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.com&#8217;s built-in Reader</a>.</p>
<p>Android users will find a few changes in the app but nothing that would effect the normal publishing workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>The post and the comment views are now split up in the Reader.</li>
<li>Live support is back in the app &#8211; contact Automattic support by going to Settings-> Help and support-> Contact</li>
</ul>
<p>Version 3.3 was essentially a janitorial release with fixes for bugs that users found to be annoying. The following items have been patched up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Videos are now correctly resized to the screen width in the Reader</li>
<li>Reader is no longer crashing with very long posts</li>
<li>Web views on the notification screen are now working when all blogs are hidden</li>
<li>Users now receive a notification that blank posts cannot be published</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don&#8217;t utilize WordPress.com features when publishing with the app, then you&#8217;re not likely to be impacted by the improvements in 3.3. The <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Android/milestones/3.4\" target=\"_blank\">3.4 milestone</a>, however, hints at the possibility of improvements to the media/themes grid layout and some important fixes for uploads. The planned enhancements will improve the experience of publishing media through the app.</p>
<p>The WP for Android app team is always looking for more beta testers. If you want to join the beta testing program, you&#8217;ll get access to new features and improvements in progress, and you will have an opportunity to offer feedback on the app&#8217;s development.
